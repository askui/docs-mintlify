description: "Build your first automation agent with AskUI"
---

In this tutorial, you'll create your first AskUI agent that automates a real-world task: searching for products on Amazon.

<Note>
**Prerequisites**: Make sure you've completed the [installation](/01-tutorials/00-prerequisites) before starting this tutorial.
</Note>

## What You'll Build

You'll create an agent that:
1. Opens Amazon in a web browser
2. Searches for a product
3. Verifies the search results
4. Generates a report of the automation

## Building Your Agent

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Your Agent Script">
    Create a new Python file `amazon_shopping.py` and add the following code:

    ```python
    from askui import VisionAgent
    import logging
    from askui import locators as loc
    from askui.reporting import SimpleHtmlReporter
    
    # Initialize your agent with logging and reporting
    with VisionAgent(
        log_level=logging.DEBUG,
        reporters=[SimpleHtmlReporter()]
    ) as agent:
        # Open Amazon website
        agent.tools.webbrowser.open_new("http://www.amazon.com")
        agent.wait(3)  # Wait for page to load
    
        # Search for a product
        agent.click(loc.Element("textfield"))
        agent.type("nike shoes")
        agent.keyboard('enter')
        agent.wait(2)  # Wait for search results
    
        # Verify page contents
        page_status = agent.get("Are Nike shoes visible on the screen?")
        print(f"Cart Status: {page_status}")
    ```

    Run the script:

    ```bash
    python amazon_shopping.py
    ```

    The script will:

    1. Open Amazon in your default browser
    2. Search for "nike shoes"
    3. Verify the cart contents
    4. Generate an HTML report of the automation
  </Step>
  <Step title="Understanding Your Code">
    Let's break down what each part does:

    ### Agent Initialization
    ```python
    with VisionAgent(log_level=logging.DEBUG, reporters=[SimpleHtmlReporter()]) as agent:
    ```
    - Creates a vision agent that can see and interact with your screen
    - Enables debug logging to see what's happening
    - Sets up HTML reporting to review the automation later

    ### Browser Control
    ```python
    agent.tools.webbrowser.open_new("http://www.amazon.com")
    agent.wait(3)
    ```
    - Opens a new browser window with Amazon
    - Waits for the page to load

    ### Element Interaction
    ```python
    agent.click(loc.Element("textfield"))
    agent.type("nike shoes")
    agent.keyboard('enter')
    ```
    - Finds and clicks the search box
    - Types the search query
    - Presses Enter to search

    ### Information Extraction
    ```python
    page_status = agent.get("Are Nike shoes visible on the screen?")
    ```
    - Uses AI to understand what's on the screen
    - Returns a natural language response
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="View the Report">
    After running your agent, open the generated HTML report:
    
    ```bash
    # The report will be in the same directory as your script
    # Look for: report_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.html
    ```
    
    The report shows:
    - Screenshots of each step
    - Actions performed
    - Execution time
    - Any errors encountered
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Enhancing Your Agent

Try these modifications to learn more:

### 1. Add Product to Cart
```python
# After searching, click on the first product
agent.click("first product image")
agent.wait(2)

# Add to cart
agent.click("Add to Cart button")
```

### 2. Use Different Selectors
```python
# Using text locator
agent.click(loc.Text("Search"))

# Using relative positioning
search_icon = loc.Element("icon").right_of(loc.Element("textfield"))
agent.click(search_icon)
```

### 3. Extract Product Information
```python
from askui import ResponseSchemaBase

class ProductInfo(ResponseSchemaBase):
    name: str
    price: float
    rating: float

product = agent.get(
    "What is the name, price, and rating of the first product?",
    response_schema=ProductInfo
)
print(f"Found: {product.name} - ${product.price} ({product.rating} stars)")
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Browser doesn't open">
    - Check if you have a default browser set
    - Try using a specific browser path
    - Ensure AskUI Agent OS is running
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Element not found">
    - Add wait times for dynamic content
    - Use more specific locators
    - Check if the element is visible on screen
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Script runs too fast">
    - Add `agent.wait()` between actions
    - Use `agent.retry()` for flaky elements
    - Enable visual debugging with screenshots
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

Congratulations! You've successfully:
- ✅ Created your first AskUI agent
- ✅ Automated browser interactions
