---

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to automate Android applications using AskUI's specialized AndroidVisionAgent. You'll build an agent that can interact with Android apps, manage device connections, and perform platform-specific operations.

<Note>
**Prerequisites**: Make sure you've completed the [installation](/01-tutorials/00-installation) and [Your First Agent](/01-tutorials/01-your-first-agent) tutorial before starting this one.
</Note>

## What You'll Build

You'll create an Android agent that:
1. Connects to an Android device or emulator
2. Launches and interacts with Android applications
3. Performs touch interactions like tapping and swiping
4. Extracts data from the Android UI
5. Uses Android-specific shell commands and key events

## Android Setup Requirements

Before building your agent, ensure you have:
- Android Debug Bridge (ADB) installed and configured in your system's PATH. ADB is the command-line tool that lets your computer communicate with an Android device. You can download it from the [Android SDK Platform Tools](https://developer.android.com/tools/releases/platform-tools).
- An Android device with USB debugging enabled (learn how to enable it in [Developer Options](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options)) or an Android emulator running
- The python-ppadb library, which is automatically installed as a dependency of askui

## Building Your Android Agent
<Steps>
<Step title="Verify Device Connection">
First, verify that your Android device is connected and accessible via ADB. Open your terminal and run:

```bash
adb devices
```

You should see your device listed with its serial number. If not, check your USB connection, ensure USB debugging is enabled on the device, or make sure your emulator is running.

```
# Example output
List of devices attached
emulator-5554	device
```

</Step>

<Step title="Create Your Android Agent Script">
Create a new Python file named `android_automation.py` and add the following code. This script will open the Android Settings app, navigate to the network settings, and then return to the home screen.

```python
from askui import AndroidVisionAgent
import logging
from askui.reporting import SimpleHtmlReporter

# Initialize your Android agent with logging and reporting
with AndroidVisionAgent(
    reporters=[SimpleHtmlReporter()]
) as agent:
    # The agent automatically connects to the first available device.
    # To select a specific device if multiple are connected, use:
    # agent.set_device_by_serial_number("<your-device-serial>")

    agent.act("Open a browser and search for AskUI")

    agent.key_tap('HOME')
```

Run the script from your terminal:

```bash
python android_automation.py
```

The agent will perform the steps on your connected Android device, and you'll see the status printed to your console. A detailed HTML report will be generated in a `reports` folder.
</Step>

<Step title="Understanding AndroidVisionAgent">
Let's break down the key API methods used in the script:

### Android Agent Initialization
```python
with AndroidVisionAgent(...) as agent:
```
- This creates an instance of the agent specifically for Android
- Using the `with` statement ensures that the connection to the device is automatically managed (connected on entry, disconnected on exit)
- The AndroidVisionAgent is a specialized [agent type](/03-explanation/01-foundations/agent-types) designed for mobile automation

### Shell Commands
```python
agent.shell("am start -n com.android.settings/.Settings")
```
- The `shell()` method is a powerful tool for executing any ADB shell command. This is the primary way to manage applications, such as starting them with `am start` or stopping them with `am force-stop`

### Touch Interactions
```python
agent.tap("Network & internet")
```
- `tap()` is the method for performing touch clicks on the screen. It can take a text description, a locator, or coordinates

### Hardware Key Events
```python
agent.key_tap('BACK')
agent.key_tap('HOME')
```
- `key_tap()` simulates pressing hardware or special keys. It accepts any key from the `ANDROID_KEY` literal type, including `BACK`, `HOME`, `VOLUME_UP`, and `ENTER`
</Step>

## Platform-Specific Features

### Device Selection

If you have multiple Android devices connected, you can target a specific one by its serial number. You can get the serial number from the `adb devices` command.

```python
with AndroidVisionAgent() as agent:
    # List devices with `adb devices` first to get the serial
    agent.set_device_by_serial_number("emulator-5554")
    
    # All subsequent commands will target this device
    agent.key_tap("HOME")
```

### Application Management via Shell

While there are no direct app.* methods, you can manage apps effectively using `agent.shell()`:

```python
# Check if an app is installed
output = agent.shell("pm list packages | grep com.example.app")
is_installed = "com.example.app" in output

# Force stop an app
agent.shell("am force-stop com.example.app")

# Clear app data (use with caution!)
agent.shell("pm clear com.example.app")
```

### Android Gestures

The agent provides built-in methods for common gestures:

```python
# Swipe from (x1, y1) to (x2, y2) over 1 second
agent.swipe(100, 800, 100, 200, duration_in_ms=1000)

# Drag an element from one point to another
agent.drag_and_drop(200, 300, 600, 300, duration_in_ms=1500)
```

## Troubleshooting Android Automation
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Device not detected">
- Ensure USB debugging is enabled in your device's Developer Options.
- Check if ADB drivers are installed correctly on your computer.
- Run `adb kill-server` and then `adb start-server` in your terminal.
- Verify your device appears in the output of `adb devices`.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="App won't launch">
- Double-check that the package name (e.g., `com.android.settings`) is correct.
- Ensure the app is installed on the target device.
- Make sure the device screen is unlocked.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Elements not found">
- Open the report generated from SimpleHTMLReporter and check if if the element is visiable on the screenshot.
- Add `agent.wait()` calls to give the UI time to load or animate.
- If an element is off-screen, use `agent.swipe()` to scroll it into view.
- Make your text prompts more specific. For example, instead of `"button"`, try `"blue login button"`.
