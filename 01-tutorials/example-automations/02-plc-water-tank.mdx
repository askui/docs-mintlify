## What This Example Shows

### Industrial Application Automation
- Interacting with Codesys-like applications
- Handling specialized industrial UI components
- Working with simulation software

### Advanced Mouse Interactions
- Dragging sliders to control water levels
- Precise mouse movements for fine control
- Handling continuous interactions (not just clicks)

### Complex Control Systems
- Managing multiple interconnected controls
- Monitoring system states and responses
- Automating control sequences

## Key Techniques Demonstrated

1. **Drag Operations**: Using mouse drag to adjust continuous values
2. **Industrial UI Elements**: Working with specialized controls found in industrial software
