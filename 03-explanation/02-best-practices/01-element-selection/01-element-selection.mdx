## Overview

Element selection is at the core of UI automation with AskUI. Understanding when and how to use different selection strategies will make your automation more reliable and maintainable.

## Natural Language vs Locators

AskUI provides two main approaches to find and select UI elements on your screen:

1. **Natural Language Selection**: Use everyday language to describe what you want to interact with
2. **Locators**: Use precise, programmatic selectors for more control and reliability

### Understanding the Difference

**Natural Language Selection** is best when:
- You want quick, readable automation scripts
- The UI elements are easily describable
- The exact text or element type might vary

**Locators** are best when:
- You need precise, deterministic selection
- Multiple similar elements exist on screen
- You need to use relative positioning

## Best Practices

### 1. Start Simple
- Use natural language selection for basic cases
- Only use locators when needed for precision

### 2. Be Specific
- Use clear, descriptive text for natural language selection
- Combine multiple locators for unique identification
- Use the correct element types with `Element()` locator

### 3. Handle Dynamic Content
- Use relative locators for elements that move
- Consider AI Elements for complex visual patterns

### 4. Multi-Monitor Setup
- Test on each monitor to find the correct display number
- Use consistent display settings across your team

## Common Selection Strategies

### Text-Based Selection
```python
# Natural language
agent.click("Submit button")

# Locator
agent.click(loc.Text("Submit"))
```

### Element Type Selection
```python
# Natural language
agent.type("user@example.com", "email field")

# Locator
agent.type("user@example.com", loc.Element("textfield"))
```

### Relative Positioning
```python
# Natural language
agent.click("button below the form")

# Locator
agent.click(loc.Element("button").below(loc.Text("Login Form")))
```

### Combining Strategies
```python
# Precise selection with multiple criteria
agent.click(
    loc.Element("button")
    .with_text("Submit")
    .right_of(loc.Text("Cancel"))
)
```

## Handling Edge Cases

### Multiple Similar Elements
When multiple elements match your selection criteria:
- Use more specific descriptions or locators
- Add relative positioning to narrow down the selection
- Consider using index-based selection for lists

### Dynamic Content
For content that changes or loads dynamically:
- Use element types rather than specific text when possible
- Implement wait strategies for elements to appear
- Use AI Elements for visual patterns that remain consistent

### Cross-Platform Differences
When automating across different platforms:
- Test your selectors on all target platforms
- Use element types that are consistent across platforms
- Consider platform-specific fallback strategies

## Performance Considerations

- Natural language selection may be slightly slower but more flexible
- Locators provide faster, more deterministic selection
- Combine both approaches based on your specific needs
