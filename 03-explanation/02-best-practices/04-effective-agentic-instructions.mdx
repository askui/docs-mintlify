The following patterns have proven to be effective for writing agentic instructions.

### **1. Use "simulate" for Enhanced Stability**

When using the Act command, the keyword _simulate_ can improve stability and accuracy. It mimics user interactions more precisely, ensuring that actions like typing or clicking are performed as a real user would.

Example:

```
agent.act("simulate a user clicking into the textfield and typing username: xyz and password: 123456")
```

By simulating actions rather than directly executing them, you reduce errors caused by UI inconsistencies or timing issues.

### **2. Add "if" Conditions for Context Awareness**

To ensure reliable execution, include conditional prompts like _if_ statements. For example, only proceed with an action if specific fields (e.g., search bars) are empty. This approach prevents unintended overwrites or conflicts in native apps.

Example:

```
agent.act("Click on Login button, if the screen does not change then that probably means that you forgot to enter the username and password, which is username: xyz and password: 123456")
```

This technique ensures the agent adapts dynamically to the application's state, improving robustness in automation workflows.

### **3. Break Actions Into Step-by-Step Instructions**

Complex tasks can be simplified by breaking them into smaller steps. This makes debugging easier and enhances reliability by ensuring each step is executed sequentially. This approach is particularly useful for multi-step processes like form filling or playing games (e.g., Blackjack), where precision is critical.

### **4. Add Verification Conditions for Stability**

Verification conditions are crucial when dealing with dynamic or ambiguous application states. For example, you can instruct the agent to proceed only if certain fields (e.g., search bars) are empty or specific UI elements are visible.

Example:

```
agent.act("""
Simulate a user doing the following actions:
1. Click on the Textfield below text username
2. Type in username: xyz
3. Click on the Textfield below text password
4. Type in password: 123456
5. Click on the Login button

Only proceed if the search bar is empty.
""")
```

This ensures that your automation script adapts dynamically to real-time application states, preventing errors like overwriting existing data.

### **5. Use Multiple Approaches for Actions**

Flexibility is key when automating tasks, especially for repetitive actions like deleting text. The AskUI Python SDK allows you to use multiple approaches for the same action, ensuring compatibility across different scenarios.

Example:

```
# Approach 1: Delete using backspace
agent.act("Simulate deleting the text 'xyz' by pressing backspace")

# Approach 2: Delete using right-click and delete option
agent.act("Simulate deleting the text 'xyz' by right-clicking and pressing delete")

# Approach 3: Delete using cmd+a and backspace
agent.act("Simulate deleting the text 'xyz' by pressing command + a, and afterwards pressing backspace")
```

By combining multiple approaches, you increase flexibility and ensure that your automation script works across various environments and input methods.
