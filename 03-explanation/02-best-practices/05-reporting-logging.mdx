AskUI provides powerful reporting and logging capabilities to help you monitor and debug your automation workflows. This guide covers how to use these features effectively.

## Logging

Enable detailed logging to better understand what your agent is doing during execution. This is particularly useful for debugging and monitoring automation workflows.

### Basic Logging

```python
import logging
from askui import VisionAgent

# Set log level to DEBUG for detailed output
with VisionAgent(log_level=logging.DEBUG) as agent:
    agent.click("Login button")
    agent.type("myuser@example.com")
```

The DEBUG log level will show you:
- Detailed information about each action
- Element detection results
- Screen capture details
- Any errors or warnings

## Reporting

AskUI's reporting system allows you to generate detailed reports of your agent's actions. This is useful for:
- Debugging automation workflows
- Documenting test runs
- Sharing results with team members
- Analyzing automation performance

### Using the Simple HTML Reporter

```python
from askui import VisionAgent
from askui.reporting import SimpleHtmlReporter

with VisionAgent(reporters=[SimpleHtmlReporter()]) as agent:
    agent.click("Login button")
    agent.type("myuser@example.com")
```

The SimpleHtmlReporter generates an HTML report containing:
- Screenshots of each action
- Timestamps
- Action details
- Success/failure status

### Creating Custom Reporters

You can create custom reporters by implementing the `Reporter` interface:

```python
from typing import Optional, Union
from typing_extensions import override
from askui.reporting import Reporter
from PIL import Image

class CustomReporter(Reporter):
    @override
    def add_message(
        self,
        role: str,
        content: Union[str, dict, list],
        image: Optional[Image.Image | list[Image.Image]] = None,
    ) -> None:
        # Add your custom message handling logic here
        pass

    @override
    def generate(self) -> None:
        # Add your custom report generation logic here
        pass

# Use your custom reporter
with VisionAgent(reporters=[CustomReporter()]) as agent:
    agent.click("Login button")
```

### Using Multiple Reporters

You can use multiple reporters simultaneously. Their methods will be called in the order they are listed:

```python
from askui import VisionAgent
from askui.reporting import SimpleHtmlReporter

with VisionAgent(reporters=[
    SimpleHtmlReporter(),  # First reporter
    CustomReporter()       # Second reporter
]) as agent:
    agent.click("Login button")
```

## Best Practices

1. **Logging Levels**
   - Use DEBUG for development and troubleshooting
   - Use INFO for normal operation
   - Use WARNING for potential issues
   - Use ERROR for critical problems

2. **Reporting**
   - Generate reports for important test runs
   - Include relevant screenshots
   - Document any failures or issues
   - Share reports with team members

3. **Custom Reporters**
   - Implement specific reporting needs
   - Add custom metrics or analytics
   - Integrate with your existing tools
   - Format reports for your team's needs

By implementing these logging and reporting features, you'll have better visibility into your automation workflows and be able to debug issues more effectively.
