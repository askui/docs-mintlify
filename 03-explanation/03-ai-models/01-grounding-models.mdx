### What models is AskUI using?

AskUI uses a **layered system of AI models,** each with a distinct role in understanding, executing, and interacting with user interfaces. Here's how we classify and use them:

1. **Locator Models** (Locators)
   1. Locator models identify and interact with UI elements on the screen.
2. **Query Models** (Asks)
   - Responsible for answering user queries or generating intelligent responses.
3. **Large Action Models** (act command) (Multi Step)
   - Responsibilites
     - Goal to â†’ Planning
     - Delegate Locator Models
     - Delegate Query Models
     - Reflection of Errors
   - UI-Tars
   - Computer-Use

   | **Model Type**     | **Model Name** | **Purpose**                            | **Teachable** | Online Trainable |
   | :----------------- | :------------- | :------------------------------------- | :------------ | :--------------- |
   | Locator          | UIDT-1         | Locate elements & understand screen    | No            | Partial          |
   | Locator          | PTA-1          | Convert prompts into one-click actions | No            | Yes              |
   | Query              | GPT-4          | Understand & respond to user queries   | Yes           | No               |
   | Query              | Computer Use   | Understand & respond to user queries   | Yes           | No               |
   | Large Action (act) | Computer Use   | Plan and execute full workflows        | Yes           | No               |
   | Large Action (act) | UI-Tars        | Plan and execute full workflows        | Yes           | No               |
