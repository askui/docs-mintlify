## Workflow

AskUI follows a systematic workflow to process and execute UI automation tasks:

## 1. Initialization

- **Load AI models**: The selected AI models are loaded into memory
- **Set up logging and reporting**: Configure logging levels and reporting mechanisms
- **Configure environment**: Set display, authentication, and other environment settings

```python
from askui import VisionAgent

# Initialization happens when creating the agent
with VisionAgent(
    log_level="INFO",
    display=1,
    model="askui"
) as agent:
    # Agent is now initialized and ready
    pass
```

## 2. Element Detection

- **Capture screen content**: Take a screenshot of the current display
- **Analyze UI elements**: Process the screenshot through AI models to identify elements
- **Match elements to commands**: Map natural language descriptions to detected elements

```python
# Element detection happens internally when you interact
agent.click("submit button")  # AskUI captures screen and finds the button
```

## 3. Action Execution

- **Plan the interaction**: Determine the best way to interact with the element
- **Perform the action**: Execute the planned interaction (click, type, etc.)
- **Verify the result**: Check if the action was successful

```python
# Action execution with verification
agent.click("save button")
# AskUI automatically verifies the click was successful
```

## 4. Error Handling

- **Detect failures**: Identify when actions fail or elements can't be found
- **Retry if needed**: Automatically retry failed actions based on configuration
- **Report issues**: Log errors and generate reports for debugging

```python
# Built-in error handling with retry
from askui import retry

@retry(max_attempts=3, wait_time=2)
def login():
    agent.type("username field", "john.doe")
    agent.type("password field", "secret123")
    agent.click("login button")
```

## Execution Flow

Here's a visual representation of how AskUI processes a command:

1. **User Command** → `agent.click("submit button")`
2. **Screen Capture** → Takes screenshot of current display
3. **AI Analysis** → Identifies all UI elements on screen
4. **Element Matching** → Finds the "submit button"
5. **Action Planning** → Determines click coordinates
6. **Execution** → Performs the click action
7. **Verification** → Confirms action was successful
8. **Result** → Returns control to user code

## Best Practices for Workflow

1. **Use context managers** to ensure proper initialization and cleanup
2. **Add appropriate wait times** between actions for dynamic content
3. **Implement retry logic** for critical actions
4. **Monitor performance** using logging and reporting features
5. **Handle errors gracefully** with try-except blocks
