<Tip>**Agentic instructions are the recommended approach for most automation tasks.**</Tip>

Instead of specifying each action, you describe what you want to accomplish. The agent figures out how to do it.

## Philosophy of Agentic Instructions

Agentic instructions operate on the principle of **intent-based automation**, where users describe what they want to accomplish rather than how to accomplish it. This approach provides:

- **Natural Language Interface**: Communicate goals in human terms
- **Adaptive Behavior**: Agents adjust to interface changes automatically
- **Reduced Maintenance**: High-level instructions remain valid despite UI changes
- **Complex Reasoning**: Agents can handle multi-step workflows autonomously

```python
# Agentic approach: intent-based control
with VisionAgent() as agent:
    agent.act("Fill out the login form with username john.doe and submit it")
    agent.act("Navigate to the user profile settings")
    agent.act("Update the display preferences to dark mode")
```
