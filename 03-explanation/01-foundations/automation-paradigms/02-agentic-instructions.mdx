<Tip>**Agentic instructions are the recommended approach for most automation tasks.**</Tip>

Instead of specifying each action, you describe what you want to accomplish. The agent figures out how to do it.

## Philosophy of Agentic Instructions

Agentic instructions operate on the principle of **intent-based automation**, where users describe what they want to accomplish rather than how to accomplish it. This approach provides:

- **Natural Language Interface**: Communicate goals in human terms
- **Adaptive Behavior**: Agents adjust to interface changes automatically
- **Reduced Maintenance**: High-level instructions remain valid despite UI changes
- **Complex Reasoning**: Agents can handle multi-step workflows autonomously

```python
# Agentic approach: intent-based control
with VisionAgent() as agent:
    agent.act("Fill out the login form with username john.doe and submit it")
    agent.act("Navigate to the user profile settings")
    agent.act("Update the display preferences to dark mode")
```

## The Agentic Approach in Practice

The agentic approach works by defining **boundaries and rules** rather than specific steps. The agent follows these guidelines to accomplish tasks autonomously. This method is particularly effective for:

- **Complex Workflows**: Multi-step processes with decision points
- **Error Recovery**: Handling unexpected states gracefully
- **Cross-Platform Testing**: Adapting to different device configurations

## Improving Agent Instructions

One of the key advantages of agentic instructions is that **you can ask the agent to improve the instructions themselves**. Agents can:

- Identify gaps in the current instructions
- Suggest more robust error handling
- Recommend additional validation steps
- Optimize instruction clarity and effectiveness

This creates a self-improving system where the automation becomes more reliable over time.
