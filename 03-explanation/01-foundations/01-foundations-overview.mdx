## Platform Capabilities

AskUI is an enterprise-ready platform that enables AI agents to control desktop and mobile devices through visual understanding. Unlike browser-only or chat-based solutions, AskUI provides comprehensive automation across all platforms and applications.

### Key Differentiators

- **Universal Platform Support**: Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS
- **Enterprise-Ready**: On-premise deployment, security features, and corporate proxy support
- **True Background Automation**: Agents can work without taking over your mouse and keyboard
- **Visual Intelligence**: No dependency on DOM or application internals
- **Flexible Integration**: Python and TypeScript SDKs with CI/CD support

## Features and Comparison

Key features of AskUI include:

- Support for **Windows**, **Linux**, **MacOS**, **Android** and **iOS** device automation, including Citrix environments
- Support for single-step commands as well as agentic instructions
- **In-background automation on Windows machines** (agent can create a second session; you do not have to watch it take over mouse and keyboard)
- Flexible model use (hot swap of models) and infrastructure for reteaching of models (available on-premise)
- **Secure deployment** of agents in enterprise environments
