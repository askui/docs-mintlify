| **access token**                        | Gives you access to the AskUI inference in combination with your workspace ID. Every access token has an expiry date and is assigned to exactly one workspace. See [Managing Access Tokens](/02-how-to-guides/01-account-management/04-tokens). |
| **action**                              | A method in the AskUI Control Client API that describes an action to be taken against the operating system, e.g., `click()`, `type()`.

| **locator**                             | A description of an UI *element* that is used to (re-)locate (find) the element on the screen, e.g., when trying to click on it; can be a simple textual description like `"login button"` or more complex, potentially multi-modal, e.g., `loc.Image("path/to/image.png").below_of(loc.Text("Login"))`. See [Vision Agent API Locators](/04-reference/01-agent-frameworks/02-python/02-vision-agent-api/locators) and [Element Selection Guide](/03-explanation/02-best-practices/01-element-selection/01-element-selection).                                                                                                                            |
