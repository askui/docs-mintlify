## Managing Workspaces

When you create an AskUI account, a default workspace is automatically created. A workspace acts as a container for your [access tokens](/account/02-tokens). By using multiple workspaces, you can easily separate and organize different sets of tokens.

## Creating a New Workspace

Your current workspace is displayed in the top-left corner of the screen. Click the workspace name to open a dropdown listing all your available workspaces. To add a new one, click **CREATE WORKSPACE**.

## Switching Workspaces

To change the current workspace, click the workspace name in the top-left corner. From the dropdown, select the workspace you want to switch to.

## Deleting a Workspace

1. Navigate to the **Workspace** page.
2. In the **General** section, click **DELETE**.
3. Confirm the deletion in the popup dialog.

**Important:** Deleting a workspace immediately removes it and all associated access tokens. There is no recovery period.
