---

This guide shows you how to report bugs, generate diagnostic information, and get help from the AskUI team.

## Before Reporting an Issue

### 1. Gather System Information

```powershell
# In askui-shell
AskUI-ShowVersions
```

Save this output - support will need it.

### 2. Check Existing Resources

- Review relevant [troubleshooting guides](/02-how-to-guides/04-troubleshooting/00-troubleshooting-overview)
- Search our [Discord community](https://discord.gg/Gu35zMGxbx) for similar issues
- Check [release notes](/04-reference/06-release-notes/00-release-notes-overview) for known issues

### 3. Document the Problem

Prepare these details:
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Expected behavior vs actual behavior
- Error messages (exact text or screenshots)
- Your code snippet that triggers the issue

## Generating Error Reports

### Automatic Error Report

The fastest way to collect diagnostic information:

1. Open Terminal/PowerShell
2. Enter `askui-shell`
3. Import debug commands:
   ```powershell
   AskUI-ImportDebugCommands
   ```
4. Generate the report:
   ```powershell
   AskUI-NewErrorReport
   ```

### Error Report Process

When you run `AskUI-NewErrorReport`:

```bash
(base) ADE C:\Users\AskUi\> AskUI-NewErrorReport
Info:  Generating a new error report...
Info:  Error description file created at 'C:\Users\AskUi\.askui\ErrorReports\[GUID]\ErrorDescription.md'
Do you want to open the error report directory? (y/n): n
Do you approve the error report content? (y/n): y
Info:  Error report compressed at 'ErrorReport-[GUID]-[DATE].zip'
Info:  Submitting error report...
Info:  Error report was submitted successfully.
```

### What's Included in Error Reports

- System information and versions
- AskUI configuration (workspace ID only, no tokens)
