This guide helps you resolve network connectivity issues, including proxy configuration and SSL/TLS certificate problems.

## Proxy

The AskUI Shell has built-in proxy autodetection. This is the **recommended approach** for handling proxy connections:

### Recommended: Proxy Autodetection (AskUI Shell)

The AskUI Shell will automatically detect and configure the proxy settings for you.

In the background, the AskUI Shell:

1. Starts the local proxy
2. Sets HTTP_PROXY environment variables

### Alternative Options

If the automatic proxy detection doesn't work for your setup, you can use these fallback options:

#### Manual Proxy Configuration

Use the AskUI Shell command to manually set proxy settings:

```bash
AskUI-SetSettings -HttpProxy <proxy> -HttpsProxy <proxy>
```

#### Start Local Proxy Manually

For advanced users who need full control over proxy configuration, you can start the local proxy manually. See the [PxProxy documentation](https://docs.askui.com/04-reference/02-askui-suite/02-askui-suite/PxProxy/Public) for detailed instructions.

## Deep Package Inspection

Company proxies, like [Zscalar](https://www.zscaler.com/resources/security-terms-glossary/what-is-cloud-proxy), use [deep package inspection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_packet_inspection) to analyze the network traffic. Such proxies are adding self-signed certificates to the HTTPS request to break up the TLS connection.

This can result in the following error messages:
```
 RequestError: self signed certificate
```
or
```
 RequestError: unable to verify the first certificate
```

You can add a self-signed certificate as extra CA Certs to solve this problem as detailed in the next section.

### Add Self-Signed Certificate as Extra CA Certs (RECOMMENDED)
The following step-by-step instructions will show you how to add the correct certificate as extra CA Certs.

1. Open the certificate viewer in your browser.

    Chrome: Depending on your operating system there is a **Lock**-icon left of your browser bar that opens the certificate viewer directly or another icon that opens a _Site Information_ menu where you have to select **Connection is Secure** -> **Certificate is Valid**

    Firefox: Click the **Lock**-icon left of your browser bar. click on **Connection Secure** -> **More Information**. Select the tab **Security**. Click **View Certificate**.

2. Chrome: Open the **Details** tab.

   Firefox: Select the **GTS Root R1** certificate.
3. Chrome: Select the Certificate **GTS Root R1** and click **Export...** on the bottom right.

   Firefox: Under **Miscellaneous**, you can download the certificate.
4. Save it somewhere you can find it.

#### Windows:

Add the following to your `<project>\.askui\Settings\AskuiEnvironmentSettings.json`

```json
{
	...
  "environmentVariables": {
    ...
    "NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS": "<insert absolute path of certificate>"
    ...
  },
  ...
}
```

#### macOS/Unix:
```bash
export NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS='<insert absolute path of certificate>'
```

## Firewall Configuration

If AskUI is blocked by your firewall, ensure the required domains are whitelisted. See the [network requirements in our Installation guide](/01-tutorials/00-installation#network-requirements) for the complete list of domains that need to be accessible.
