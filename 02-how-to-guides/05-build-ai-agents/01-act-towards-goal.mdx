title: Act towards goal
description: Use the act() command to accomplish tasks with natural language
---

The [`act()`](/04-reference/01-agent-frameworks/02-python/02-vision-agent-api/agent#act) command lets you describe what you want to achieve in natural language, and the AI agent figures out how to do it.

## Basic Usage

```python
from askui import Agent

with Agent() as agent:
    agent.tools.webbrowser.open_new("https://docs.askui.com")
    agent.wait(3)  # Wait for page to load

    agent.act("open the search field and search for agentic mode")
```

## When to Use act()

Use [`act()`](/04-reference/01-agent-frameworks/02-python/02-vision-agent-api/agent#act) when you want to:
- Quickly prototype an automation
- Handle complex multi-step workflows
- Work with UIs that change frequently
- Let the AI figure out the best approach

For more control over individual steps, see the guides on [selecting elements](./01-select-elements) and [extracting data](./02-extract-data).
