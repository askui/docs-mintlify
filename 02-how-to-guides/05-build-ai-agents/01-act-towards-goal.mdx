title: Act towards goal
description: Use the act() command to accomplish tasks with natural language
---

The [`act()`](/04-reference/01-agent-frameworks/02-python/02-vision-agent-api/agent#act) command lets you describe what you want to achieve in natural language, and the AI agent figures out how to do it.

## Basic Usage

```python
from askui import VisionAgent

with VisionAgent() as agent:
    agent.act("click the login button")
```

## Complex Tasks

```python
# Multi-step workflow
agent.act("book a flight from Berlin to Paris in January")

# Form filling
agent.act("fill out the registration form with name John Doe and email john@example.com")

# Navigation and data extraction
agent.act("go to the products page and tell me the price of the first laptop")
```

## Practical Examples

### E-commerce
```python
agent.act("""
Purchase a blue t-shirt:
1. Search for blue t-shirt
2. Select size medium
3. Add to cart
4. Proceed to checkout
""")
```

### Data Collection
```python
result = agent.act("extract all email addresses from this page")
print(result)
```

## When to Use act()

Use [`act()`](/04-reference/01-agent-frameworks/02-python/02-vision-agent-api/agent#act) when you want to:
- Quickly prototype an automation
- Handle complex multi-step workflows
- Work with UIs that change frequently
- Let the AI figure out the best approach

For more control over individual steps, see the guides on [selecting elements](./01-select-elements) and [extracting data](./02-extract-data).
