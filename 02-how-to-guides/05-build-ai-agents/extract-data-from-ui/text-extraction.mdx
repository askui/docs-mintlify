title: Text Extraction
description: Extract text content from UI elements
---

Extract text content from your UI using string response schemas. This is useful for reading labels, messages, form values, and any textual content.

## Basic Usage

```python
from askui import Agent

agent = Agent()
agent.start()

agent.tools.webbrowser.open_new("http://www.example.com")
agent.wait(3)

text = agent.get("What is the main heading?", response_schema=str)
print(f"main heading: {text}")
```

## Best Practices

1. **Be Specific About Location**: Mention where the text is located
   ```python
   # Good - specific location
   header = agent.get("What is the text in the page header?", response_schema=str)
   
   # Less specific
   text = agent.get("What text is shown?", response_schema=str)
   ```

2. **Handle Empty or Missing Text**: Consider that text might not exist
   ```python
   from typing import Optional
   
   # Text might not be present
   optional_text = agent.get("What is the subtitle, if any?", response_schema=Optional[str])
   
   if optional_text:
       print(f"Subtitle: {optional_text}")
   ```

3. **Clean and Validate Extracted Text**: Post-process extracted text as needed
   ```python
   # Extract and clean price
   price_text = agent.get("What is the price?", response_schema=str)
   price_value = float(price_text.replace("$", "").replace(",", ""))
   ```
