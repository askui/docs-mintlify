title: Text Extraction
description: Extract text content from UI elements
---

Extract text content from your UI using string response schemas. This is useful for reading labels, messages, form values, and any textual content.

## Basic Usage

```python
from askui import Agent

agent = Agent()
agent.start()

# Get any text from the screen
text = agent.get("What is the main heading?", response_schema=str)

# Get specific element text
username = agent.get("What is the username shown?", response_schema=str)
error_msg = agent.get("What is the error message?", response_schema=str)
```

## Common Use Cases

### Form Field Values
```python
# Read current form values
current_email = agent.get("What email is entered in the email field?", response_schema=str)
selected_option = agent.get("What option is selected in the dropdown?", response_schema=str)
```

### Labels and Headings
```python
# Extract UI labels
page_title = agent.get("What is the page title?", response_schema=str)
section_heading = agent.get("What is the heading of the main section?", response_schema=str)
button_text = agent.get("What text is on the submit button?", response_schema=str)
```

### Messages and Notifications
```python
# Read dynamic messages
success_msg = agent.get("What is the success message shown?", response_schema=str)
notification = agent.get("What is the notification text?", response_schema=str)
status = agent.get("What is the current status displayed?", response_schema=str)
```

### Multiple Text Items
```python
from typing import List

# Get multiple text items
menu_items = agent.get("What are all the menu items?", response_schema=List[str])
options = agent.get("What are all the dropdown options?", response_schema=List[str])
error_messages = agent.get("What are all the error messages shown?", response_schema=List[str])
```

## Specific Examples

### Reading User Information
```python
# Extract user profile data
name = agent.get("What is the user's name displayed in the profile?", response_schema=str)
email = agent.get("What email address is shown?", response_schema=str)
role = agent.get("What is the user's role?", response_schema=str)

print(f"User: {name} ({email}) - Role: {role}")
```

### Extracting Product Details
```python
# Get product information
product_name = agent.get("What is the product name?", response_schema=str)
price = agent.get("What is the price text shown?", response_schema=str)
description = agent.get("What is the product description?", response_schema=str)
```

### Reading Table Headers
```python
# Extract table column names
headers = agent.get("What are all the table column headers?", response_schema=List[str])
print(f"Table columns: {', '.join(headers)}")
```

## Best Practices

1. **Be Specific About Location**: Mention where the text is located
   ```python
   # Good - specific location
   header = agent.get("What is the text in the page header?", response_schema=str)
   
   # Less specific
   text = agent.get("What text is shown?", response_schema=str)
   ```

2. **Handle Empty or Missing Text**: Consider that text might not exist
   ```python
   from typing import Optional
   
   # Text might not be present
   optional_text = agent.get("What is the subtitle, if any?", response_schema=Optional[str])
   
   if optional_text:
       print(f"Subtitle: {optional_text}")
   ```

3. **Clean and Validate Extracted Text**: Post-process extracted text as needed
   ```python
   # Extract and clean price
   price_text = agent.get("What is the price?", response_schema=str)
   price_value = float(price_text.replace("$", "").replace(",", ""))
   ```

## Common Patterns

### Dynamic Content Verification
```python
# Wait for and verify dynamic content
welcome_msg = agent.get("What is the welcome message after login?", response_schema=str)
assert "Welcome" in welcome_msg, "Should show welcome message after login"
```

### Conditional Actions Based on Text
```python
# Take action based on text content
status = agent.get("What is the order status?", response_schema=str)

if status == "Pending":
    agent.click("Process Order")
elif status == "Failed":
    agent.click("Retry")
```

### Text Comparison
```python
# Compare displayed text with expected
displayed_total = agent.get("What is the total amount shown?", response_schema=str)
expected_total = "$150.00"

if displayed_total != expected_total:
    print(f"Total mismatch: expected {expected_total}, got {displayed_total}")
```
