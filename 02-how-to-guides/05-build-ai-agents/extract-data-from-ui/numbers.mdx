title: Extracting Numbers
description: Get numeric values like counts, prices, and metrics from UI
---

Extract numeric values from your UI using integer and float response schemas. This is essential for reading counts, prices, percentages, and other numeric data.

## Basic Usage

```python
from askui import Agent

agent = Agent()
agent.start()

# Get single numbers
price = agent.get("What is the total price?", response_schema=float)
count = agent.get("How many items are in the cart?", response_schema=int)
percentage = agent.get("What is the discount percentage?", response_schema=float)
```

## Integer vs Float

Choose the appropriate numeric type based on your data:

```python
# Use int for counts and whole numbers
item_count = agent.get("How many products are displayed?", response_schema=int)
page_number = agent.get("What is the current page number?", response_schema=int)
notifications = agent.get("How many unread notifications?", response_schema=int)

# Use float for decimals, prices, percentages
price = agent.get("What is the product price?", response_schema=float)
rating = agent.get("What is the average rating?", response_schema=float)
progress = agent.get("What is the completion percentage?", response_schema=float)
```

## Multiple Numbers

Extract lists of numeric values:

```python
from typing import List

# Get multiple numbers
quantities = agent.get("What are all the quantities shown?", response_schema=List[int])
prices = agent.get("What are all the product prices?", response_schema=List[float])
scores = agent.get("What are the test scores displayed?", response_schema=List[int])
```

## Common Use Cases

### Shopping Cart Analysis
```python
# Extract cart information
item_count = agent.get("How many items are in the cart?", response_schema=int)
subtotal = agent.get("What is the subtotal amount?", response_schema=float)
tax = agent.get("What is the tax amount?", response_schema=float)
total = agent.get("What is the total amount?", response_schema=float)

# Verify calculations
calculated_total = subtotal + tax
assert abs(total - calculated_total) < 0.01, "Total calculation mismatch"
```

### Dashboard Metrics
```python
# Read dashboard statistics
active_users = agent.get("How many active users are shown?", response_schema=int)
revenue = agent.get("What is today's revenue?", response_schema=float)
conversion_rate = agent.get("What is the conversion rate percentage?", response_schema=float)
```

### Pagination
```python
# Handle pagination
current_page = agent.get("What is the current page number?", response_schema=int)
total_pages = agent.get("What is the total number of pages?", response_schema=int)
items_per_page = agent.get("How many items are shown per page?", response_schema=int)

print(f"Page {current_page} of {total_pages}")
```

### Inventory Management
```python
# Check stock levels
in_stock = agent.get("How many items are in stock?", response_schema=int)
low_stock_threshold = 10

if in_stock < low_stock_threshold:
    agent.click("Reorder")
    reorder_quantity = agent.get("What is the suggested reorder quantity?", response_schema=int)
```

## Specific Example: Counting Elements

```python
# Count various UI elements
card_count = agent.get("How many cards are displayed?", response_schema=int)
print(f"Found {card_count} cards")

# Use the count for validation or iteration
if card_count > 0:
    for i in range(1, card_count + 1):
        card_title = agent.get(f"What is the title of card number {i}?", response_schema=str)
        print(f"Card {i}: {card_title}")
```

## Best Practices

1. **Specify Units When Relevant**: Be clear about what units you expect
   ```python
   # Good - clear about units
   price_dollars = agent.get("What is the price in dollars?", response_schema=float)
   weight_kg = agent.get("What is the weight in kilograms?", response_schema=float)
   
   # Less clear
   price = agent.get("What is the price?", response_schema=float)
   ```

2. **Handle Zero and Negative Values**: Consider edge cases
   ```python
   balance = agent.get("What is the account balance?", response_schema=float)
   
   if balance < 0:
       print("Account overdrawn!")
   elif balance == 0:
       print("Zero balance")
   ```

3. **Validate Numeric Ranges**: Check if values are within expected ranges
   ```python
   percentage = agent.get("What is the progress percentage?", response_schema=float)
   
   # Validate percentage is between 0 and 100
   assert 0 <= percentage <= 100, f"Invalid percentage: {percentage}"
   ```

## Common Patterns

### Progress Tracking
```python
# Monitor task progress
completed = agent.get("How many tasks are completed?", response_schema=int)
total = agent.get("How many total tasks?", response_schema=int)
percentage = (completed / total) * 100 if total > 0 else 0

print(f"Progress: {completed}/{total} ({percentage:.1f}%)")
```

### Price Comparisons
```python
# Compare prices
original_price = agent.get("What is the original price?", response_schema=float)
sale_price = agent.get("What is the sale price?", response_schema=float)
discount = original_price - sale_price
discount_percent = (discount / original_price) * 100

print(f"Save ${discount:.2f} ({discount_percent:.0f}% off)")
```

### Statistical Analysis
```python
# Gather numeric data for analysis
values = agent.get("What are all the data values in the chart?", response_schema=List[float])

if values:
    avg = sum(values) / len(values)
    max_val = max(values)
    min_val = min(values)
    
    print(f"Average: {avg:.2f}, Range: {min_val} - {max_val}")
```
