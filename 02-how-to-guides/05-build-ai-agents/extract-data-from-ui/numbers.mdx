title: Extracting Numbers
description: Get numeric values like counts, prices, and metrics from UI
---

Extract numeric values from your UI using integer and float response schemas. This is essential for reading counts, prices, percentages, and other numeric data.

## Basic Usage

```python
from askui import VisionAgent

with VisionAgent() as agent:
    agent.tools.webbrowser.open_new("http://www.example.com")
    agent.wait(3)

    result = agent.get("How many headings do you see?", response_schema=int)
    print(f"result: {result}")
```

## Best Practices

1. **Specify Units When Relevant**: Be clear about what units you expect
   ```python
   # Good - clear about units
   price_dollars = agent.get("What is the price in dollars?", response_schema=float)
   weight_kg = agent.get("What is the weight in kilograms?", response_schema=float)
   
   # Less clear
   price = agent.get("What is the price?", response_schema=float)
   ```

2. **Validate Numeric Ranges**: Check if values are within expected ranges
   ```python
   percentage = agent.get("What is the progress percentage?", response_schema=float)
   
   # Validate percentage is between 0 and 100
   assert 0 <= percentage <= 100, f"Invalid percentage: {percentage}"
   ```
