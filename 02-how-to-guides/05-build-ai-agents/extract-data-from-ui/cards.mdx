Card layouts are popular UI patterns for displaying grouped information. Learn how to extract data from cards, including their selection states and complex fields.

## Basic Card Extraction

```python
from askui import ResponseSchemaBase, VisionAgent
from typing import List, Optional

class Card(ResponseSchemaBase):
    title: str
    description: str
    button_text: str
    image_url: Optional[str] = None

with VisionAgent() as agent:
    cards = agent.get(
        "Extract all card information",
        response_schema=List[Card]
    )
    
    # Process cards
    for card in cards:
        print(f"{card.title}: {card.description}")
```

## Best Practices

1. **Handle Empty States**: Check for "no results" cards
   ```python
   with VisionAgent() as agent:
       cards = agent.get("Extract all cards", response_schema=List[Card])
       
       if not cards:
           # Check for empty state message
           empty_message = agent.get(
               "What does the empty state message say?",
               response_schema=str
           )
   ```

2. **Pagination for Card Grids**: Handle large collections
   ```python
   with VisionAgent() as agent:
       all_cards = []
       page = 1
       
       while True:
           page_cards = agent.get(
               "Extract visible cards on current page",
               response_schema=List[Card]
           )
           all_cards.extend(page_cards)
           
           has_more = agent.get("Is there a 'Load More' button?", response_schema=bool)
           if has_more:
               agent.click("Load More")
               page += 1
           else:
               break
   ```

3. **Dynamic Card Loading**: Handle lazy-loaded content
   ```python
   with VisionAgent() as agent:
       # Scroll to load more cards
       initial_count = agent.get("How many cards are visible?", response_schema=int)
       
       agent.scroll("down", 500)
       agent.wait(2)  # Wait for loading
       
       new_count = agent.get("How many cards are visible?", response_schema=int)
       if new_count > initial_count:
           print(f"Loaded {new_count - initial_count} more cards")
   ```
