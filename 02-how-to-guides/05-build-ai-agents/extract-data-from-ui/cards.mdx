Card layouts are popular UI patterns for displaying grouped information. Learn how to extract data from cards, including their selection states and complex fields.

## Basic Card Extraction

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import List, Optional
from askui import Agent

agent = Agent()
agent.start()

class Card(BaseModel):
    title: str
    description: str
    button_text: str
    image_url: Optional[str] = None

cards = agent.get(
    "Extract all card information",
    response_schema=List[Card]
)

# Process cards
for card in cards:
    print(f"{card.title}: {card.description}")
```

## Cards with Selection State

Track which cards are selected or active:

![Card Example](images/card-example.png)

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from typing import List
from datetime import datetime

class SelectableCard(BaseModel):
    title: str
    model: str
    selected: bool  # Track selection state
    date: str = Field(description="The date in ISO format, e.g., '2023-10-01T12:00:00Z'")

# Extract cards with their selection states
cards = agent.get(
    "Extract all the cards information including which one is selected",
    response_schema=List[SelectableCard]
)

# Find selected card
selected_card = next((card for card in cards if card.selected), None)
if selected_card:
    print(f"Selected: {selected_card.title} - {selected_card.model}")

# Count cards
total_cards = len(cards)
selected_count = sum(1 for card in cards if card.selected)
print(f"{selected_count} of {total_cards} cards selected")
```

## Product Cards

For e-commerce or catalog layouts:

```python
class ProductCard(BaseModel):
    name: str
    price: float
    original_price: Optional[float] = None
    discount_percentage: Optional[int] = None
    rating: float
    review_count: int
    in_stock: bool
    image_url: str

products = agent.get(
    "Extract all product cards",
    response_schema=List[ProductCard]
)

# Find discounted products
on_sale = [p for p in products if p.discount_percentage]
print(f"{len(on_sale)} products on sale")

# Find top-rated products
top_rated = [p for p in products if p.rating >= 4.5]
```

## Dashboard Cards

For metric and KPI cards:

```python
class MetricCard(BaseModel):
    title: str
    value: str
    change_percentage: float
    change_direction: str  # "up", "down", "neutral"
    time_period: str
    icon: Optional[str] = None

dashboard_cards = agent.get(
    "Extract all dashboard metric cards",
    response_schema=List[MetricCard]
)

# Analyze performance
improving = [m for m in dashboard_cards if m.change_direction == "up"]
declining = [m for m in dashboard_cards if m.change_direction == "down"]

print(f"Metrics improving: {len(improving)}")
print(f"Metrics declining: {len(declining)}")
```

## Grid Layouts

For card grids with positioning:

```python
class GridCard(BaseModel):
    content: str
    row: int
    column: int
    width: int = 1  # Spans multiple columns
    height: int = 1  # Spans multiple rows

grid_cards = agent.get(
    "Extract the grid layout cards with their positions",
    response_schema=List[GridCard]
)

# Reconstruct grid layout
max_row = max(card.row for card in grid_cards)
max_col = max(card.column for card in grid_cards)

grid = [[None for _ in range(max_col + 1)] for _ in range(max_row + 1)]
for card in grid_cards:
    grid[card.row][card.column] = card.content
```

## Interactive Cards

Cards with multiple actions:

```python
class InteractiveCard(BaseModel):
    title: str
    content: str
    primary_action: str
    secondary_action: Optional[str] = None
    can_dismiss: bool = False
    is_expanded: bool = False

cards = agent.get(
    "Extract all interactive cards",
    response_schema=List[InteractiveCard]
)

# Interact with cards
for card in cards:
    if not card.is_expanded:
        agent.click(f"Expand the {card.title} card")
    
    # Perform primary action
    agent.click(card.primary_action)
```

## Card Filtering and Sorting

Managing card collections:

```python
class FilterableCard(BaseModel):
    title: str
    category: str
    tags: List[str]
    date_created: str
    is_visible: bool

all_cards = agent.get(
    "Extract all cards including hidden ones",
    response_schema=List[FilterableCard]
)

# Apply filters
visible_cards = [c for c in all_cards if c.is_visible]

# Group by category
from collections import defaultdict
by_category = defaultdict(list)
for card in visible_cards:
    by_category[card.category].append(card)

# Find cards by tag
def find_by_tag(cards: List[FilterableCard], tag: str):
    return [c for c in cards if tag in c.tags]
```

## Common Patterns

### News/Article Cards
```python
class ArticleCard(BaseModel):
    headline: str
    summary: str
    author: str
    publish_date: str
    read_time: str
    image_url: str
    category: str

articles = agent.get(
    "Extract all article cards",
    response_schema=List[ArticleCard]
)

# Sort by date
from datetime import datetime
articles.sort(key=lambda x: datetime.fromisoformat(x.publish_date), reverse=True)
```

### Team Member Cards
```python
class TeamMemberCard(BaseModel):
    name: str
    role: str
    department: str
    email: str
    phone: Optional[str] = None
    avatar_url: str
    is_online: bool

team = agent.get(
    "Extract all team member cards",
    response_schema=List[TeamMemberCard]
)

# Find online team members
online_members = [m for m in team if m.is_online]
```

### Feature Cards
```python
class FeatureCard(BaseModel):
    feature_name: str
    description: str
    icon: str
    is_available: bool
    requires_upgrade: bool
    documentation_link: Optional[str] = None

features = agent.get(
    "Extract all feature cards",
    response_schema=List[FeatureCard]
)

# Identify upgrade opportunities
upgrade_features = [f for f in features if f.requires_upgrade]
```

## Best Practices

1. **Handle Empty States**: Check for "no results" cards
   ```python
   cards = agent.get("Extract all cards", response_schema=List[Card])
   
   if not cards:
       # Check for empty state message
       empty_message = agent.get(
           "What does the empty state message say?",
           response_schema=str
       )
   ```

2. **Pagination for Card Grids**: Handle large collections
   ```python
   all_cards = []
   page = 1
   
   while True:
       page_cards = agent.get(
           "Extract visible cards on current page",
           response_schema=List[Card]
       )
       all_cards.extend(page_cards)
       
       has_more = agent.get("Is there a 'Load More' button?", response_schema=bool)
       if has_more:
           agent.click("Load More")
           page += 1
       else:
           break
   ```

3. **Dynamic Card Loading**: Handle lazy-loaded content
   ```python
   # Scroll to load more cards
   initial_count = agent.get("How many cards are visible?", response_schema=int)
   
   agent.scroll("down", 500)
   time.sleep(2)  # Wait for loading
   
   new_count = agent.get("How many cards are visible?", response_schema=int)
   if new_count > initial_count:
       print(f"Loaded {new_count - initial_count} more cards")
   ```

## Counting Cards Example

Simple card counting for validation:

```python
# Count cards for summary
card_count = agent.get("How many cards are displayed?", response_schema=int)
print(f"Total cards: {card_count}")

# Validate against extracted data
extracted_cards = agent.get("Extract all cards", response_schema=List[Card])
assert len(extracted_cards) == card_count, "Card count mismatch"
```
