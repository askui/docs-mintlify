## Setting Up Your Pipeline

<Steps>
  <Step title="Project Structure">
    Create a `tests` directory in your repository root to store your AskUI Python scripts.
    
    > Note: The directory name may vary based on your project organization.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Pipeline Steps">
    ### 1. Environment Setup
    - Set up Python 3.10 or higher
    - Install dependencies with `pip install askui`
    - *Optional:* Configure AskUI Agent OS as a service

    ### 2. Environment Variables
    Configure the following required variables:
    ```bash
    ASKUI_WORKSPACE_ID=<your-workspace-id>
    ASKUI_TOKEN=<your-token>
    ```

    For AI model integration:
    ```bash
    ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<your-api-key> # Required if using Anthropic models
    ```

    ### 3. Execute Tests
    Run your AskUI workflows:
    ```bash
    python -m pytest tests/
    # Or run your scripts directly
    python your_automation_script.py
    ```

    ### 4. Reporting
    - Generate test reports with pytest-html
    - Deploy or distribute reports as needed
  </Step>
