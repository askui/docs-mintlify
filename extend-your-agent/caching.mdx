title: Caching
description: Record actions, replay without AI inference.

<Warning>Experimental. API may change.</Warning>

Record agent actions once, replay instantly. Skip AI reasoning for known workflows.

## Record (Write)

```python
from askui.models.shared.settings import CachingSettings

with VisionAgent() as agent:
    agent.act(
        goal="Log in as admin",
        caching_settings=CachingSettings(
            strategy="write",
            cache_dir=".cache",
            filename="login.json"
        )
    )
```

## Replay (Read)

```python
with VisionAgent() as agent:
    agent.act(
        goal="Log in",
        caching_settings=CachingSettings(
            strategy="read",
            cache_dir=".cache"
        )
    )
```

## Auto Mode (Both)

Try cache first, record if not found:

```python
caching_settings=CachingSettings(
    strategy="both",
    cache_dir=".cache",
    filename="checkout.json"
)
```

## Strategies

| Strategy | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| `"no"` | Default. No caching. |
| `"write"` | Record to file |
| `"read"` | Replay from file |
| `"both"` | Cache first, record if missing |

## Limitations

- UI state sensitive—assumes same state as recording
- Re-record when UI changes significantly
