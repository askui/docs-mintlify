## Common Issues and Troubleshooting

This guide addresses the most frequent challenges users encounter with AskUI and provides solutions to resolve them.

## Proxy and Network Issues

Corporate networks often use proxies that can interfere with AskUI's installation and operation.

### Installation Through Proxy Servers

If you're experiencing issues installing AskUI through NTLM or Kerberos proxy servers:

1. Set up a local proxy like [Px](https://github.com/genotrance/px)
2. Configure pip to use your local proxy
3. Proceed with installation

For detailed instructions, see our [Proxy Configuration Guide](/introduction/05-agent-os/04-proxy).

### Connection Problems

If AskUI Controller cannot connect to AskUI Inference:

- Check your proxy settings in AskUI Agent OS using `AskUI-ShowSettings`
- Configure proxy settings with `AskUI-SetSettings`
- Verify TLS certificate configuration if using HTTPS inspection

## Installation Issues

Common installation problems include:

- **Missing dependencies**: Ensure your system meets all [prerequisites](/introduction/02-getting-started/01-prerequisites)
- **Permission errors**: Try running installation commands with administrator privileges
- **Version conflicts**: Check compatibility between AskUI components

## Model Reliability and Accuracy

If you're experiencing issues with AI model accuracy:

- Use more specific element descriptions in your commands
- Consider [AI Elements](/introduction/03-core-concepts/01-element-selection) for consistent element selection
- Request model retraining for your specific application interfaces

For improving model accuracy, see our [Reteaching Models](/introduction/05-agent-os/03-reteaching) guide.
