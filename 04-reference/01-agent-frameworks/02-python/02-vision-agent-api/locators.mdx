## askui.locators.AiElement

```python
class AiElement(ImageBase)
```

Locator for finding ui elements by data (e.g., image) collected with the [AskUIRemoteDeviceSnippingTool](http://localhost:3000/02-api-reference/02-askui-suite/02-askui-suite/AskUIRemoteDeviceSnippingTool/Public/AskUI-NewAIElement) using the `name` assigned to the AI element during *snipping* to retrieve the data used for locating the ui element(s).

**Arguments**:

- `name` _str_ - Name of the AI element
- `threshold` _float, optional_ - A threshold for how similar UI elements need to be to the image to be considered a match.
  Takes values between `0.0` (= all elements are recognized) and `1.0` (= elements need to look exactly
  like defined). Defaults to `0.5`. Important: The threshold impacts the prediction quality.
- `stop_threshold` _float | None, optional_ - A threshold for when to stop searching for UI elements similar to the image. As soon
  as UI elements have been found that are at least as similar as the `stop_threshold`, the search stops.
  Should be greater than or equal to `threshold`. Takes values between `0.0` and `1.0`. Defaults to value of
  `threshold` if not provided. Important: The `stop_threshold` impacts the prediction speed.
- `mask` _list[tuple[float, float]] | None, optional_ - A polygon to match only a certain area of the image. Must have at least 3 points.
  Defaults to `None`.
- `rotation_degree_per_step` _int, optional_ - A step size in rotation degree. Rotates the image by rotation_degree_per_step
  until 360° is exceeded. Range is between `0°` - `360°`. Defaults to `0°`. Important: This increases the
  prediction time quite a bit. So only use it when absolutely necessary.
- `name` _str | None, optional_ - Name for the image. Defaults to random name.
- `image_compare_format` _Literal["RGB", "grayscale", "edges"], optional_ - A color compare style. Defaults to `'grayscale'`. **Important**:
  The `image_compare_format` impacts the prediction time as well as quality. As a rule of thumb,
  `'edges'` is likely to be faster than `'grayscale'` and `'grayscale'` is likely to be faster than `'RGB'`.
  For quality it is most often the other way around.

**Arguments**:

- `class_name` _Literal["switch", "text", "textfield"] | None, optional_ - The class of the ui element, e.g., `'text'` or `'textfield'`. Defaults to `None`.
  

**Examples**:

    ```python
    from askui import locators as loc
    # locates a text elementAdd 
    text = loc.Element(class_name="text")
    # locates a textfield element

    element = loc.Element()
    ```

<a id="askui.locators.Image"></a>

## askui.locators.Image

```python
class Image(ImageBase)
```

Locator for finding ui elements by an image.

**Arguments**:

- `image` _Union[PIL.Image.Image, pathlib.Path, str]_ - The image to match against (PIL Image, path, or string)
- `threshold` _float, optional_ - A threshold for how similar UI elements need to be to the image to be considered a match.
  Takes values between `0.0` (= all elements are recognized) and `1.0` (= elements need to look exactly
  like defined). Defaults to `0.5`. Important: The threshold impacts the prediction quality.
- `stop_threshold` _float | None, optional_ - A threshold for when to stop searching for UI elements similar to the image. As soon
  as UI elements have been found that are at least as similar as the `stop_threshold`, the search stops.
  Should be greater than or equal to `threshold`. Takes values between `0.0` and `1.0`. Defaults to value of

- `index` _RelationIndex, optional_ - Index of the element (located by *self*) **left of** the other
  element(s) (located by *other_locator*), e.g., the first (`0`), second (`1`), third (`2`) etc. element left of the other
  element(s). Elements' (relative) position is determined by the **right
  border** (*x*-coordinate) of their bounding box.
  We don't guarantee the order of elements with the same right border
  (*x*-coordinate). Defaults to `0`.
- `reference_point` _ReferencePoint, optional_ - Defines which element (located by *self*) is considered to be
  *left of* the other element(s) (located by *other_locator*). Defaults to `"center"`.
  

**Returns**:

- `Self` - The locator with the relation added

<a id="askui.locators.Relatable.nearest_to"></a>

#### nearest\_to

```python
def nearest_to(other_locator: "Relatable") -> Self
```

Defines the element (located by *self*) to be the nearest to another element
(located by *other_locator*).

**Arguments**:

- `other_locator` _Relatable_ - The locator to compare distance against
  

**Returns**:

- `Self` - The locator with the relation added
  

**Examples**:

    ```text
    --------------
    |    text    |
    --------------
    ---------------
    | textfield 1 |
    ---------------




    ---------------
    | textfield 2 |
    ---------------
    ```
    ```python
    from askui import locators as loc

    # Returns textfield 1 because it is nearer to the text than textfield 2
    textfield = loc.Element().nearest_to(loc.Text())
    ```

<a id="askui.locators.Relatable.or_"></a>

#### or\_

```python
def or_(other_locator: "Relatable") -> Self
```

Logical or operator to combine multiple locators, e.g., to provide a fallback
if no element is found for one of the locators.

**Arguments**:

- `other_locator` _Relatable_ - The locator to combine with
  

**Returns**:

- `Self` - The locator with the relation added
  

**Examples**:

    ```python
    from askui import locators as loc

    # Searches for element using a description and if the element cannot be
    # found, searches for it using an image
    search_icon = loc.Prompt("search icon").or_(
        loc.Image("search_icon.png")
    )
    ```

<a id="askui.locators.Relatable.raise_if_cycle"></a>

#### raise\_if\_cycle

```python
def raise_if_cycle() -> None
```

Raises CircularDependencyError if the relations form a cycle (see [Cycle (graph theory)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_(graph_theory))).

<a id="askui.locators.RelationIndex"></a>

## askui.locators.RelationIndex

```python
RelationIndex = Annotated[int, Field(ge=0)]
```

Index of the element *A* above, below, right or left of the other element *B*,
e.g., the first (`0`), second (`1`), third (`2`) etc. element
above, below, right or left of the other element *B*. *A*'s position relative
to other elements above, below, right or left of *B*
(which determines its index) is determined by the relative position of its
lowest (above), highest (below), leftmost (right) or rightmost (left) point(s)
(edge of its bounding box).

**Important**: Which elements are counted ("indexed") depends on the locator used, e.g.,
when using `Text` only text matched is counted, and the `reference_point`.

**Examples**:

  
```text
===========
|    A    | ===========
=========== |    B    |
            ===========
                   ===========                  
                   |    C    |                  
    ===========    ===========                  
    |    D    |
    ===========
```
  
  For `reference_point`
  - `"center"`, *A* is the first (`index=0`) element above *B*.
  - `"boundary"`, *A* is the second (`index=1`) element above *B*.
  - `"any"`, *A* is the third (`index=2`) element above *B*.

<a id="askui.locators.Text"></a>

## askui.locators.Text

```python
class Text(Element)
```

Locator for finding text elements by their textual content.

**Arguments**:

- `text` _str | None, optional_ - The text content of the ui element, e.g., `'Sign up'`. Defaults to `None`.
  If `None`, the locator will match any text element.
- `match_type` _TextMatchType, optional_ - The type of match to use. Defaults to `"similar"`.
- `similarity_threshold` _int, optional_ - A threshold for how similar the actual text content of the ui element
  needs to be to the specified text to be considered a match when `match_type` is `"similar"`.
  Takes values between `0` and `100` (inclusive, higher is more similar).
  Defaults to `70`.
  

**Examples**:

    ```python
    from askui import locators as loc
    # locates a text element with text similar to "Sign up", e.g., "Sign up" or "Sign Up" or "Sign-Up"
    text = loc.Text("Sign up")
    # if it does not find an element, you can try decreasing the similarity threshold (default is `70`)
    text = loc.Text("Sign up", match_type="similar", similarity_threshold=50)
    # if it also locates "Sign In", you can try increasing the similarity threshold (default is `70`)
    text = loc.Text("Sign up", match_type="similar", similarity_threshold=80)
    # or use `match_type="exact"` to require an exact match (does not match other variations of "Sign up", e.g., "Sign Up" or "Sign-Up")
    text = loc.Text("Sign up", match_type="exact")
    # locates a text element starting with "Sign" or "sign" using a regular expression
    text = loc.Text("^[Ss]ign.*", match_type="regex")
    # locates a text element containing "Sign" (exact match)
    text = loc.Text("Sign", match_type="contains")
    ```

<a id="askui.locators.TextMatchType"></a>

## askui.locators.TextMatchType

```python
TextMatchType = Literal["similar", "exact", "contains", "regex"]
```

The type of match to use.

- `"similar"` uses a similarity threshold to determine if the text is a match.
- `"exact"` requires the text to be exactly the same (this is not the same as `"similar"` 
  with a `similarity_threshold` of `100` as a `similarity_threshold` of `100` can still 
  allow for small differences in very long texts).
- `"contains"` requires the text to contain (exactly) the specified text.
- `"regex"` uses a regular expression to match the text.

<a id="askui.locators.Relatable.right_of"></a>

#### right\_of

```python
def right_of(
    other_locator: "Relatable",
    index: RelationIndex = 0,
    reference_point: ReferencePoint = "center"
) -> Self
```

Defines the element (located by *self*) to be **right of** another element /
other elements (located by *other_locator*).

An element **A** is considered to be *right of* another element / other elements **B**

- if most of **A** (or, more specifically, **A**'s bounding box) is *right of* **B**
(or, more specifically, the **right border** of **B**'s bounding box) **and**
- if the **left border** of **A** (or, more specifically, **A**'s bounding box) is
*right of* the **left border** of **B** (or, more specifically, **B**'s
bounding box).

**Arguments**:

- `other_locator` _Relatable_ - Locator for an element / elements to relate to
- `index` _RelationIndex, optional_ - Index of the element (located by *self*) **right of** the other
  element(s) (located by *other_locator*), e.g., the first (`0`), second (`1`), third (`2`) etc. element right of the other
  element(s). Elements' (relative) position is determined by the **left
  border** (*x*-coordinate) of their bounding box.
  We don't guarantee the order of elements with the same left border
  (*x*-coordinate). Defaults to `0`.
- `reference_point` _ReferencePoint, optional_ - Defines which element (located by *self*) is considered to be
  *right of* the other element(s) (located by *other_locator*). Defaults to `"center"`.
  

**Returns**:

- `Self` - The locator with the relation added
  

**Examples**:

    ```text

    =========== ===========
    |    B    | |    A    |
