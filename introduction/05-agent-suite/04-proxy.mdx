title: Proxy & TLS Configuration
description: 'Welcome to the home of your new documentation'

In enterprise settings, proxies are commonly used to secure and control network traffic. You may encounter proxy-related issues at two points:

1. During AskUI installation
2. When AskUI Controller connects to AskUI Inference

## Installing AskUI Through NTLM or Kerberos Proxy Server

NTLM or Kerberos proxies require authentication via your Windows user or username/password combination. We recommend using a local proxy to handle authentication.

### Setting Up a Local Proxy

We recommend [Px](https://github.com/genotrance/px) as a local proxy:

1. Install Px following their documentation
2. Start the proxy (default port: 3128)

<Note>
Choose the binary option if package managers aren't available in your environment.
</Note>

#### Windows Startup Configuration

Create a `px-start.bat` file in your Px installation folder:

```batch
cd c:\tools\px
px.exe
```

To set up autostart:
1. Create a link to `px-start.bat`
2. Press `Windows + R`, enter `shell:startup`
3. Move the link to this folder

### Configure pip to Use Proxy

Create a `pip.conf` file (Linux/macOS) or `pip.ini` file (Windows):

**Linux/macOS** (`~/.config/pip/pip.conf`):
```ini
[global]
proxy = http://127.0.0.1:3128
```

**Windows** (`%APPDATA%\pip\pip.ini`):
```ini
[global]
proxy = http://127.0.0.1:3128
```

### Set Environment Variables

```python
# Add to your Python script to configure proxy at runtime
import os
os.environ['HTTP_PROXY'] = 'http://127.0.0.1:3128'
os.environ['HTTPS_PROXY'] = 'http://127.0.0.1:3128'
```

Or set them in your system:

**Linux/macOS**:
```bash
export HTTP_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:3128
export HTTPS_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:3128
```

**Windows**:
```batch
set HTTP_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:3128
set HTTPS_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:3128
```

## AskUI Controller Connection to AskUI Inference

### Using Default Configuration with Requests

The Python client uses the `requests` library which supports proxies. You can configure proxies in two ways:

#### Method 1: Using Environment Variables

Set the environment variables as shown above. The `requests` library will automatically use these variables.

#### Method 2: Explicitly Configure Proxies in Code

```python
from askui import AskuiClient

proxies = {
    'http': 'http://your-proxy-url:port',
    'https': 'https://your-proxy-url:port'
}

# Initialize AskUI client with proxy configuration
askui_client = AskuiClient(proxy_config=proxies)
```

### Proxy Authentication

If your proxy requires authentication:

```python
proxies = {
    'http': 'http://username:password@your-proxy-url:port',
    'https': 'https://username:password@your-proxy-url:port'
}

askui_client = AskuiClient(proxy_config=proxies)
```

## Handling SSL/TLS Certificate Issues

Corporate proxies often perform Deep Package Inspection by adding self-signed certificates to HTTPS requests. This can cause errors like:

```
SSLError: self-signed certificate
```

or

```
SSLError: unable to verify the first certificate
```

### Adding Custom Certificates (Recommended)

<Accordion title="Certificate Configuration Options">

#### Method 1: Environment Variable

```python
import os
os.environ['REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE'] = '/path/to/your/certificate.pem'
```

#### Method 2: Directly in Code

```python
import requests
from askui import AskuiClient

# Initialize client with custom certificate
askui_client = AskuiClient(
    verify='/path/to/your/certificate.pem'
)
```

</Accordion>

### Extracting the Required Certificate

1. Open the certificate viewer in your browser:
   - **Chrome**: Click the lock icon in the address bar → "Certificate"
   - **Firefox**: Click the lock icon → "Connection Secure" → "More Information" → "View Certificate"

2. Select the root certificate (often "GTS Root R1" for corporate proxies)

3. Export/download the certificate in PEM format

4. Save it to a location accessible by your Python script

<Warning>
**Security Note**: Disabling certificate verification (`verify=False`) is not recommended in production environments as it makes your connection vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting

If you're still experiencing connectivity issues:

```python
# Enable verbose logging for debugging
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```

<Tip>
For advanced proxy configurations or issues with specific corporate networks, please contact AskUI support with details about your environment.
