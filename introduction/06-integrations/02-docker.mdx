We maintain Docker images for running instructions with AskUI inside a Docker Container, for example, locally or in a CI/CD pipeline. The images are based on Ubuntu (amd64) images and contain the AskUI Controller and a browser. The AskUI SDK connects to the AskUI Controller inside the Docker container to execute workflows inside it.

You can find our images onÂ [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/askuigmbh/askui-ui-controller).

  The **Using AskUI in Docker** guide explains how to run AskUI in containers for local and CI/CD environments using pre-built Docker images. It covers **setup, configuration, connecting to the AskUI SDK, and monitoring via VNC**, with support limited to **amd64 architectures**.
