### **Getting Started with AskUI on Your Machine**

To set up AskUI on your device, start by signing up at [askui.com](https://askui.com) and following the onboarding steps. A **free trial account** is available, so you can explore the product before committing.

If you're using AskUI in an **enterprise network**, you may need to configure **Proxy & TLS settings**. You can find more details [here](/introduction/06-integrations/07-proxy).

### **Installing the AskUI Development Environment**

Before you can build and run AI-powered Vision Agents, you’ll need to install the **AskUI Development Environment**. This package includes everything required to:
✅ Sync agents to your local device
✅ Run agents locally
✅ Allow agents to interact with your device (e.g., typing, clicking)
✅ And more

The installation is **straightforward** and takes about **10 minutes**.

### **Supported Platforms**

We provide **installers** for:

* **Windows** (AMD64, ARM64)

* **macOS** (ARM64 only)

* **Linux** (AMD64, ARM64)

🚨 **Note for Mac Users:** We do **not yet support AMD64 (Intel-based Macs)**. If you need Intel support, please let us know!

Before installing, ensure you've **downloaded the installer from** [askui.com](https://askui.com) **and checked the required box during onboarding.**

Once installed, you’re ready to start automating with AskUI!&#x20;

ℹ️ You can install only the **Python library** and use your own models by running `pip install askui` or visiting our [**GitHub Vision Agent**](https://github.com/askui/vision-agent). However, if you want to use **AskUI-hosted models**, an access token is required.
