### **Getting Started with AskUI on Your Machine**  

To set up AskUI on your device, start by signing up at [askui.com](https://askui.com) and following the onboarding steps. A **free trial account** is available, so you can explore the product before committing.  

If you're using AskUI in an **enterprise network**, you may need to configure **Proxy & TLS settings**. You can find more details [here](/introduction/06-integrations/07-proxy).  

### **Installing the AskUI Development Environment**  
Before you can build and run AI-powered Vision Agents, youâ€™ll need to install the **AskUI Development Environment**. This package includes everything required to:  
âœ… Sync agents to your local device  
âœ… Run agents locally  
âœ… Allow agents to interact with your device (e.g., typing, clicking)  
âœ… And more  

The installation is **straightforward** and takes about **10 minutes**.  

### **Supported Platforms**  
We provide **installers** for:  
- **Windows** (AMD64, ARM64)  
- **macOS** (ARM64 only)  
- **Linux** (AMD64, ARM64)  

ðŸš¨ **Note for Mac Users:** We do **not yet support AMD64 (Intel-based Macs)**. If you need Intel support, please let us know!  

Before installing, ensure you've **downloaded the installer from [askui.com](https://askui.com) and checked the required box during onboarding.**  

Once installed, youâ€™re ready to start automating with AskUI! ðŸš€
