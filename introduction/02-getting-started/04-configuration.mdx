## **Setup Agent - Instructions**

1. Open a Terminal
   A terminal (also known as command line or console) is a program that provides a text-based interface to interact with your computer. You'll need it to run commands for syncing your agent to your device.

### Sync Your AI Agent to Your Local Device&#xA;

Run the following commands in your terminal to set up your agent:

### Start the AskUI Development Environment (ADE)

`askui-shell`

This makes AskUI commands (AskUI-\*) and dependencies available within the terminal.

### Connect local ADE to your Workspace


To connect your ADE to your workspace, you need an access token and set it in the settings. You only need to do this once for your local device for your workspace, so if you have done this already, you can skip this step. Otherwise, generate one now.

1. Generate Access Token using our Onboarding - hub.askui.com&#x20;


2. Install the Runner

`AskUI-InstallRunner`

This installs the component (the Runner) which allows you to synchronize agents created within the AskUI Hub with your local device, downloading and uploading the latest changes.

1. Download Your Agent to Your Local Device

`AskUI-SyncAgents -Direction DOWN`

1. Open Your Agent

`AskUI-OpenAgent -ID 7ddbaaf8-4d10-4b39-823e-2207094b34fd`Run Your Agent:&#x20;



Your agent is a basically a folder that contains:

* `agent.yml` - Contains metadata about the agent

* Files with logic and assets of the agent, for example, Python files

* `README.md` - Contains setup and running instructions

Check the README.md file for detailed instructions on how to setup and run your agent.

### Edit and Sync Changes

After making changes to your agent locally, sync them back to AskUI Hub:

1. Edit Your Agent
   Open and edit your agent files in your preferred code editor. Common files to edit:

* Python files containing your agent's logic

* Configuration files

* Asset files (images, data files, etc.)

### Sync Changes to AskUI Hub

`AskUI-SyncAgents -Direction UP`

This uploads your local changes to AskUI Hub, making them available to other team members.
