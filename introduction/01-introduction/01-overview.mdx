## What is AskUI?

AskUI enables AI to control your desktop and mobile devices. We make Windows, MacOS, Linux, Android and iOS accessible for AI agents by finding elements on screen and allowing our Agent OS execute agent commands on operating systems.

## Features and Comparison

Key features of AskUI include:

- Support for **Windows**, **Linux**, **MacOS**, **Android** and **iOS** device automation, including Citrix environments
- Support for single-step commands as well as agentic instructions
- **In-background automation on Windows machines** (agent can create a second session; you do not have to watch it take over mouse and keyboard)

- **Secure deployment** of agents in enterprise environments
