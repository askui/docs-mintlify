## **What is AskUI?**

AskUI is a powerful automation tool that lets you **interact with any software, on any operating system, just like a human would**. It recognizes UI elements on the screen and can perform actions like clicking buttons, typing in text fields, or executing commands—without needing complex programming knowledge.

In this guide, we’ll explain:

- How AskUI works
- The key components that power it
- How you can start automating tasks easily

By the end, you’ll **understand how to use AskUI to automate UI interactions efficiently.** 🚀

---

## **How AskUI Works**

AskUI is built on three key components that work together:

1. **AskUI Control Client** – The main interface where you tell AskUI what to do.
2. **AskUI Controller** – The tool that carries out your automation on the computer.
3. **AskUI Inference Server** – The brain behind AskUI that recognizes UI elements on your screen.

Let’s go through each one in simple terms. 👇

---

## **1. AskUI Control Client: The Command Center**

The **AskUI Control Client** is where you **tell AskUI what to automate**. It provides a user-friendly API that allows you to create instructions.

For example, let’s say you want AskUI to click a "Login" button. The instruction would look like this:

```
await aui.click().button().withText('Login').exec();

```

Here’s what’s happening:

- **`click()`** → Specifies the action (clicking).
- **`button().withText('Login')`** → Identifies the UI element (a button with "Login" text).
- **`exec()`** → Executes the command.

💡 **Key takeaway:** The AskUI Control Client makes automation simple by using easy-to-read instructions.

### **What happens next?**

Once you give a command, the Control Client:

1. Sends a request to the **AskUI Controller** (to perform an action like clicking).
2. Sends a request to the **AskUI Inference Server** (to analyze the screen and find elements if needed).

---

## **2. AskUI Controller: The Execution Engine**

The **AskUI Controller** is the part that **physically interacts with your operating system**. Think of it as a remote control for your computer—it listens to instructions from the Control Client and performs the requested actions.

### **What does it do?**

- Takes screenshots of your screen (to identify UI elements).
- Performs interactions like **clicking, typing, and pressing keys**.
- Runs commands in the background to automate actions.

💡 **Example:** If you tell AskUI to **press three keys at once**, the AskUI Controller will execute it immediately:

```
await aui.pressThreeKeys('control','alt','del').exec();

```

👉 **No need to analyze the screen—this action is performed directly by the Controller.**

---

## **3. AskUI Inference Server: The AI Brain**

The **AskUI Inference Server** is where the magic happens! 🧠✨ This server uses AI to **"see" your screen** and recognize different UI elements.

### **How does it work?**

1. The Control Client takes a **screenshot** of your screen.
2. The screenshot is sent to the Inference Server.
3. The AI model **identifies UI elements** like buttons, text fields, or icons.
4. The results are sent back, and automation continues.

🔍 **What can it recognize?**

- **Buttons** (e.g., "Login", "Submit")
- **Text Fields** (e.g., input boxes)
- **Icons** (e.g., user profile icon)
- **Custom Elements** (you can define specific areas to be recognized)

💡 **Example:** If you tell AskUI to click a button, but the system first needs to "find" it, the Inference Server helps locate it before performing the action.

---

## **How AskUI Works in Action**

Let’s put everything together! Here’s what happens when you run an AskUI command:

### **Scenario 1: Clicking a Button**

```
await aui.click().button().withText('Confirm').exec();

```

🔹 **Step 1:** AskUI Control Client sends the request.

🔹 **Step 2:** The Inference Server checks the screen for the "Confirm" button.

🔹 **Step 3:** The AskUI Controller receives the command and clicks the button.

✅ **Result:** The button is clicked automatically!

---

### **Scenario 2: Pressing Shortcut Keys**

```
await aui.pressThreeKeys('control','alt','del').exec();

```

🔹 **Step 1:** The AskUI Control Client sends the request.

🔹 **Step 2:** The AskUI Controller triggers the keyboard shortcut instantly.

✅ **Result:** The keys are pressed at the same time!
