# **How Vision Agents Can Help You**

Vision Agents make it easier to automate interactions with applications by using AI to interpret and act on visual elements. Whether you're testing software or streamlining workflows, they help reduce manual effort and improve efficiency.

Our two main use cases are:

### **1. Test Automation** üîç

Automate UI testing across different platforms by interacting with applications visually. Unlike traditional automation that relies only on code-based selectors, Vision Agents add a layer of adaptability by recognizing on-screen elements, making tests more resilient to UI changes.

### **2. Process Automation with AI Agents** ‚öôÔ∏è

Automate repetitive workflows that involve interacting with multiple applications. Vision Agents use AI to interpret screen elements and execute tasks based on predefined instructions, helping teams save time and reduce errors.

While Vision Agents still rely on code for defining tasks, they provide a more flexible and visual approach to automation. We are also actively working on introducing **new options for less technical users** to make automation even more accessible.
