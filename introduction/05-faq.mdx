# 2. Model Questions

### What models is AskUI using?

\
AskUI uses a **layered system of AI models,** each with a distinct role in understanding, executing, and interacting with user interfaces. Here's how we classify and use them:

1. [Grounding Models](https://docs.askui.com/introduction/04-ai-models/01-grounding-models) (Locators)
   1. Grounding models identify and interact with UI elements on the screen.
2. **Query Models** (Asks)
   - Responsible for answering user queries or generating intelligent responses.
3. **Large Action Models** (act command) (Multi Step)
   - Responsibilites
     - Goal to → Planning
     - Delegate Grounding Models
     - Delegate Query Models
     - Reflection of Errors
   - UI-Tars
   - Computer-Use

   | **Model Type**     | **Model Name** | **Purpose**                            | **Teachable** | Online Trainable |
   | ------------------ | -------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------- | ---------------- |
   | Grounding          | UIDT-1         | Locate elements & understand screen    | No            | Partial          |
   | Grounding          | PTA-1          | Convert prompts into one-click actions | No            | Yes              |
   | Query              | GPT-4          | Understand & respond to user queries   | Yes           | No               |
   | Query              | Computer Use   | Understand & respond to user queries   | Yes           | No               |
   | Large Action (act) | Computer Use   | Plan and execute full workflows        | Yes           | No               |
   | Large Action (act) | UI-Tars        | Plan and execute full workflows        | Yes           | No               |

### What exactly is the **AskUI UIDT-1 Model?**

A powerful model composed of multiple specialized sub-models:

- **Element Detector**

  Trained to detect 9 key UI element types (like buttons, text fields, checkboxes, etc.).
- **End-to-End OCR (Optical Character Recognition)**

  Used to read and understand text in the UI:
  - **Text Recognition**: A _teachable model_ that learns from user corrections.
  - **Text Detection**: Locates where text appears on the screen.
- **DSL (Domain-Specific Language)**

  Allows precise descriptions of UI actions.

### How does the **Prompt-to-Action (PTA-1)**  work? – _Single-Step Execution_

- Converts natural language prompts into direct UI actions.
- Built as a _teachable model_ to continuously improve from user feedback.

### What is a **Large Action Models (LAM)** – _Multi-Step Execution_

These are higher-level models responsible for planning and executing more complex workflows.

**Responsibilities:**

- **Planning**: Understand a user goal and break it into steps.
- **Delegation**: Assign tasks to Grounding or Query models.
- **Reflection**: Analyze and correct errors during execution.

**Includes:**

- **UI-Tars**: Task agents specialized in certain UI flows.
- **Computer-Use**: Models that simulate a real user interacting with a full application or system.

---

### What is the difference between Teaching vs. Training?

**Teaching**

**Teaching** is about helping the model improve or adapt **without changing its underlying neural network weights.**

Instead, you guide it using **examples, rules, or context.** It’s often about using **prompts, memory, or interaction history** to adjust model behavior in a targeted and efficient way.

**Teaching in AskUI includes:**

- **Prompt Engineering:** Giving clear, contextual instructions like _“Click on the login button”_ helps models interpret intent more accurately.
- **LLMs and LAMs are teacheable models, like GPT4, Anthropic Claude etc**

Training

**Training** involves changing the internal parameters of a model - its **weights -** through exposure to **large datasets** and feedback signals. \
\
This is computationally expensive and typically happens during development, online training or in batch processes. OCR re-teaching is on example of training and AskUI supports online training.

**Online-Training in AskUI includes:**

- [OCR Re-Training (UIDT-1)](https://www.askui.com/blog-posts/how-to-retrain-your-text-elements-with-askui-ocr-teaching-app):

  Our OCR engine is a composite of teachable and trainable models. While you can “teach” it by correcting recognized text, deeper improvements (like recognizing new font types or edge cases) require training on more labeled images.
- [**Prompt-to-Action (e.g., PTA-1):**](https://docs.askui.com/02-api-reference/02-askui-suite/02-askui-suite/AskUIRemoteDeviceSnippingTool/Experimental/AskUI-NewAnnotationsForTraining)

  These models incorporate feedback from user corrections. For example, if a button click fails, and the user clarifies the intended target, the model updates its interpretation next time.

---

### Why Use Both ?

AskUI combines **training and teaching** because:

- **Teaching is agile**: It empowers users to refine behavior instantly.
- **Training is foundational**: It builds the core capabilities of the model.

| Aspect                | Teaching                          | Training                       |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Speed                 | Immediate or near real-time       | Takes time (minutes to hours)  |
| Who does it?          | Users or **automation**           | Developers/Engineers           |
| Affects Model Weights | ❌ No                              | ✅ Yes                          |
| Flexibility           | High - works with new scenarios   | Medium - needs structured data |
| Example in AskUI      | PTA-1 prompt learning, OCR tweaks | UIDT-1 model expansion         |

### How can I use dotenv instead of askui-shell for Access Token?

If you prefer not to use the AskUI Shell, you can expose your ASKUI_WORKSPACE_ID and ASKUI_TOKEN via a .env file using [python-dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/).

**🛠 Setup Steps**
1. Install the package:

```bash
pip install python-dotenv
```
2. Create a .env file in your project root:
```env
ASKUI_WORKSPACE_ID=<your workspace id>
ASKUI_TOKEN=<your access token>
```
> Need a token? See: [Create Access Tokens](https://docs.askui.com/03-account/01-account-management/04-tokens#create-access-token)

3. Load in Python:
```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()

...
from askui import VisionAgent

with VisionAgent() as agent:

### Error: ButtonEvent down failed: Access is denied (Windows only)

The AskUI Agent OS may be unable to send button events (like left-clicks) to the screen in certain situations. This typically occurs when either the **Lock Screen** is active or the **RDP client** is minimized.

**Lock Screen:** If the machine is on the Lock Screen, AskUI cannot interact with it. This is because the lock screen is controlled by the SYSTEM process, which has higher privileges than the AskUI controller. As a result, clicking is no longer possible.

**Remote Desktop (RDP):** When using Remote Desktop (RDP), minimizing the RDP client on the local machine sets the remote session to an idle state, preventing any UI interactions. This is standard behavior.

To work around this RDP limitation, you can set the following registry key on the client machine (not the remote host):
```
Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Terminal Server Client
DWORD RemoteDesktop_SuppressWhenMinimized 2
```
This change keeps the remote session active and allows AskUI to continue sending interactions, even when the RDP window is minimized.

# 5. Pricing Questions

### **What is an Ask?**

An **ask()** refers to one **action or inference call** that AskUI performs. This involves taking a **screenshot** to localize an element on the screen, which is a key part of interacting with UI elements visually.

For example, if you have a test case where a user browses through a menu, like this:

1. `click('nav bar')`
2. `click('home')`
3. `ask('is the home site visible?')`

In this case, there are **3 asks** or inference calls:

- The first two `click()` commands **do count as asks**, as they require screenshots to localize the elements (even if it's for interaction purposes).
- The third action, `ask('is the home site visible?')`, also counts as **one ask/inference call**, since it involves taking a screenshot to verify if the element is visible.

However, simple **mouse actions** such as `scroll()`, `leftclick()`, or other actions that do not require localization or element recognition (i.e., no screenshot taken) **do not count as asks**.

### **How is Pricing for Ask Commands Calculated?**

\
Each **ask()** call (which involves one screenshot) will be counted toward your usage, and the pricing is based on the total number of asks or inference calls made during the automation process.

### **How is the Act Command Priced?**

The **act()** command is a more advanced action that involves multi-step workflows and typically requires **interaction with external models** such as **Anthropic's Claude Sonnet** (or other models like OpenAI, etc.) for task execution. As such, **act()** is priced separately.\
The pricing for **act()** commands is determined by the **license agreement** for the external model being used. For example, if you're using **Claude Sonnet** by Anthropic, charges will be based on the number of calls made to the model during task execution. The pricing model can vary depending on the specific external model (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, or other AI providers).
