Selecting the right UI elements is crucial for creating reliable automation workflows. This guide provides strategies to improve accuracy and performance when interacting with UI elements.

### Example: Calculator Automation

```python
from askui import VisionAgent

with VisionAgent() as agent:
    # Open Chrome and navigate to calculator
    agent.tools.webbrowser.open_new("https://askui.github.io/askui-practice-	page/")

    # Click numbers and operators
    agent.click("7")
    agent.click("+")
    agent.click("7")
    agent.click("=")

    # Extract the result
    result = agent.get("What is the calculation result?")
    print(f"The result is: {result}")
```

## Natural Language Element Selection

AskUI's Vision Agent uses natural language prompts to identify and interact with UI elements on your screen. This approach offers several advantages:

- **Intuitive Descriptions**: Use everyday language to describe elements like "login button" or "search field"
- **Contextual Understanding**: The agent understands elements based on their visual appearance and surrounding context
- **Flexibility**: No need to learn complex selector syntax or DOM structures

### How Natural Language Selection Works

When you provide a natural language prompt like "login button", the Vision Agent:

1. Captures the current screen state
2. Analyzes the visual elements present
3. Identifies the element that best matches your description
4. Performs the requested action on that element

## AI Elements

AI Elements allow you to capture and use specific visual elements from your screen for reliable automation.

<Note>
  Enable the AskUI Development Environment as described in the installation guide and activate experimental commands by running `AskUI-ImportExperimentalCommands` in your terminal.
</Note>

```bash
AskUI-NewAIElement
```

This command captures elements from your screen for use in AskUI workflows.

It then can be used by setting the model config to `askui-ai-element`, like:

```Python
agent.click("ai-element-name", model_name="askui-ai-element")
```

**Parameters:**

- **Name** (Optional): The name for the screenshot file. If defined, indicates only one element is being captured. For multiple elements, you'll provide names individually.
- **WorkspaceId** (Optional): Uses the Workspace ID from settings by default. Required if not in settings.
- **AlwaysPreview** (Optional): Automatically opens preview without prompting. Cannot be used with NoPreview.
- **NoPreview** (Optional): Skips the preview. Cannot be used with AlwaysPreview.
- **OneShot** (Optional): Ends snipping after first successful AI Element creation.
- **Annotate** (Optional): Takes a fullscreen capture for region annotation.

**Example Output:**

By implementing these techniques, you'll build **more reliable, flexible, and accurate** automation workflows that can handle complex UI interactions with confidence.
