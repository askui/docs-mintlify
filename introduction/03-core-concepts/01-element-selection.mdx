# Finding and Selecting UI Elements

AskUI provides multiple ways to find and select UI elements on your screen. This guide covers the different approaches, from simple text-based selection to advanced locator strategies.

## Natural Language Selection

The simplest way to interact with UI elements is using natural language descriptions. AskUI's Vision Agent understands everyday language to find elements on your screen.

```python
from askui import VisionAgent

with VisionAgent() as agent:
    # Find and click a button
    agent.click("Login button")
    
    # Find and type in a text field
    agent.type("myuser@example.com")
    
    # Find and hover over a menu item
    agent.mouse_move("Settings menu")
```

### Benefits of Natural Language Selection

- **Intuitive**: Use everyday language to describe elements
- **Context-Aware**: Understands elements based on their visual appearance and surroundings
- **Flexible**: Works across different applications and interfaces
- **Maintainable**: No need to update selectors when UI changes slightly

## Advanced Selection with Locators

For more precise element selection, use AskUI's locator system to build sophisticated element selectors.

### Basic Locators

```python
from askui import locators as loc

with VisionAgent() as agent:
    # Find by text
    agent.click(loc.Text("Submit"))
    
    # Find by element type
    agent.click(loc.Element("textfield"))  # Find a text field
    agent.click(loc.Element("text"))       # Find a text element
    
    # Find by image
    agent.click(loc.Image("logo.png"))
```

### Relative Locators

Build complex selectors by describing element relationships:

```python
from askui import locators as loc

with VisionAgent() as agent:
    # Find a text field next to a label
    password_label = loc.Text("Password")
    password_field = loc.Element("textfield").right_of(password_label)
    
    # Find text below a heading
    submit_text = loc.Element("text").below_of(loc.Text("Complete Registration"))
    
    # Find an element near another element
    menu_item = loc.Text("Settings").nearest_to(loc.Image("user-icon.png"))
```

### Available Locator Methods

- `Text()`: Find elements by their text content
- `Element()`: Find elements by their type:
  - `"text"`: Text elements
  - `"textfield"`: Input fields
- `Image()`: Find elements by their visual appearance
- `AiElement()`: Use AI-captured elements for reliable selection

### Locator Relationships

- `right_of()`: Element is to the right of another element
- `left_of()`: Element is to the left of another element
- `above()`: Element is above another element
- `below()`: Element is below another element
- `near()`: Element is near another element

## Multi-Monitor Support

When working with multiple monitors, specify which display to automate:

```python
with VisionAgent(display=1) as agent:  # Use primary display
    agent.click("Element on first monitor")

with VisionAgent(display=2) as agent:  # Use secondary display
    agent.click("Element on second monitor")
```

## AI Elements

For complex or dynamic elements, use AI Elements to capture and reuse specific visual elements:

```bash
# Capture elements from your screen
AskUI-NewAIElement
```

Use captured AI Elements in your code:

```python
from askui import locators as loc

with VisionAgent() as agent:
    agent.click(loc.AiElement("my-element-name"))
```

<Note>
  If you cannot use the AskUI-NewAIElement command, activate experimental commands by running `AskUI-ImportExperimentalCommands` in your terminal.

## Best Practices

1. **Start Simple**
   - Use natural language selection for basic cases
   - Only use locators when needed for precision
2. **Be Specific**
   - Use clear, descriptive text for natural language selection
   - Combine multiple locators for unique identification
   - Use the correct element types with `Element()` locator
3. **Handle Dynamic Content**
   - Use relative locators for elements that move
   - Consider AI Elements for complex visual patterns
4. **Multi-Monitor Setup**
   - Test on each monitor to find the correct display number
   - Use consistent display settings across your team

By following these guidelines, you'll create robust and maintainable element selection strategies for your automation workflows.
