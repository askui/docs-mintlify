When you need to extract specific text information—such as the name of a selected card or the last modified date of an item—you can use the `agent.get()` method with a string (`str`) response schema.

This approach is useful for retrieving dynamic content, validating UI text, or making assertions in your tests.

**Example Page**

Suppose you have the following cards in your application:

**Examples:**

```python
text = agent.get("Which is the name of the selected card?", response_schema=str)
assert text == "Basic Vision Agent", "The name of the selected card should be 'Basic Vision Agent'"
```

```python
text = agent.get("What is the last modified date of the 'PDF to Execel Agent'?", response_schema=str)
assert text == "May 28th, 2025", "The last modified date of the 'PDF to Execel Agent' should be 'May 28th, 2025'"
```

This approach allows you to extract and validate specific text values from your application, making your tests more precise and robust.
