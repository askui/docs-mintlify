When you need to extract specific numeric information—such as the number of cards, items, or elements on a page—you can use the `agent.get()` method with an integer (`int`) response schema.

This approach is useful for validating counts, checking UI state, or making assertions in your tests.

**Example Page**

Suppose you have the following cards in your application:

**Example:**

```python
number = agent.get("How many cards do you see?", response_schema=int)
assert number == 6, "There should be 6 cards on the page"
```

This approach allows you to extract and validate specific numeric values from your application, making your tests more precise and robust.

> **Tip:**  
> Use clear, unambiguous questions to ensure reliable numeric answers from the agent.
