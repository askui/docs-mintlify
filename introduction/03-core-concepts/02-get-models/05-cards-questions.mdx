You can use the agent to extract card data from your application UI, converting each card into a structured object. This is useful for validating content, automating reporting, or further processing in your workflows.

To do this, define a response schema that models the cards and their fields:

```python
class Card(ResponseSchemaBase):
    title: str
    description: str
    date: str = Field(description="The date in ISO format, e.g., '2023-10-01T12:00:00Z'")
    selected: bool  # Indicates whether the card is currently selected or active

class Cards(ResponseSchemaBase):
    cards: List[Card]
```

The `selected` field indicates whether the card is currently selected or active in the UI. This can be useful for tracking user interactions or highlighting the current context.

Then, use the agent to extract all cards from your application:

```python
with VisionAgent() as agent:
    result = agent.get("Can you extract me all the cards of the page?", response_schema=Cards)
    print(result.model_dump_json(indent=2))
```

**Example**

Suppose you have the following cards in your application:

![AskUI Documentation Cards](images/card-example.png)

The extracted output would look like:

```json
{
  "cards": [
    {
      "title": "QA Agent with Pytest",
      "description": "This agent contains a Pytest QA Agent.",
      "date": "2025-05-28T00:00:00Z",
      "selected": false
    },
    {
      "title": "Basic Vision Agent",
      "description": "This agent contains a basic Python Vision Agent.",
      "date": "2025-05-28T00:00:00Z",
      "selected": true
    },
    {
      "title": "Plc Application Vision Agent",
      "description": "This agent contains a basic Python Vision Agent that interacts with a PLC application.",
      "date": "2025-05-28T00:00:00Z",
      "selected": false
    },
    {
      "title": "Tic Tac Toe Vision Agent",
      "description": "This agent contains a basic Python Vision Agent that plays Tic Tac Toe.",
      "date": "2025-05-28T00:00:00Z",
      "selected": false
    },
    {
      "title": "Web Scraping Agent",
      "description": "This agent contains a AskUI Web Scraping Agent. It scrapes data from a website and stores it in a text file.",
      "date": "2025-05-28T00:00:00Z",
      "selected": false
    },
    {
      "title": "PDF to Excel Agent",
      "description": "This agent takes pdfs from a folder and converts them into an excel file. Extracted information can be changed in the prompt.",
      "date": "2025-05-28T00:00:00Z",
      "selected": false
    }
  ]
}
```

This approach allows you to retrieve the cards as a structured JSON object, making it easy to inspect, validate, or process the data programmatically.

> **Tip:**  
> Adjust the schema to match your cardâ€™s fields, and use clear instructions to get accurate results.
