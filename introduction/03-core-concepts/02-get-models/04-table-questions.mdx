You can use the agent to extract table data from your application UI, converting rows and columns into structured objects. This is useful for validating data, automating reporting, or further processing in your workflows.

To do this, define a response schema that models the table and its entries:

```python
class Entry(ResponseSchemaBase):
    model_name: str
    infor: str
    execution_speed: str
    security: str
    costs: str
    reliability: str

class Table(ResponseSchemaBase):
    rows: List[Entry]
```

Then, use the agent to extract the table from your application:

```python
with VisionAgent() as agent:
    result = agent.get("Can you extract me the table?", response_schema=Table)
    print(result.model_dump_json(indent=2))
```

**Example**

Suppose you have the following table in your application:

![AskUI Documentation Sidebar](images/table_website.png)

The extracted output would look like:

```json
{
  "rows": [
    {
      "model_name": "askui",
      "infor": "AskUI is a combination of all models below. You let AskUI decide which model to use based on the task so that you don’t have to worry about selecting the right model, also supports get()",
      "execution_speed": "Fast, ‘<500ms per step’",
      "security": "Secure hosting by AskUI or on-premise",
      "costs": "Low, ‘<0.05$ per step’",
      "reliability": "Recommended for production usage, can be partially retrained"
    },
    {
      "model_name": "askui-pta",
      "infor": "PTA-1 (Prompt-to-Automation) is a vision language model (VLM) trained by AskUI which to address all kinds of UI elements by a textual description e.g. \"Login button\", \"Text login\"",
      "execution_speed": "Fast, ‘<500ms per step’",
      "security": "Secure hosting by AskUI or on-premise",
      "costs": "Low, ‘<0.05$ per step’",
      "reliability": "Recommended for production usage, can be retrained"
    },
    {
      "model_name": "askui-ocr",
      "infor": "AskUI OCR is an OCR model trained to address texts on UI Screens e.g. \"Login\", \"Search\"",        
      "execution_speed": "Fast, ‘<500ms per step’",
      "security": "Secure hosting by AskUI or on-premise",
      "costs": "Low, ‘<0.05$ per step’",
      "reliability": "Recommended for production usage, can be retrained"
    },
    {
      "model_name": "askui-combo",
      "infor": "AskUI Combo is a combination from the askui-pta and the askui-ocr model to improve the accuracy.",   
      "execution_speed": "Fast, ‘<500ms per step’",
      "security": "Secure hosting by AskUI or on-premise",
      "costs": "Low, ‘<0.05$ per step’",
      "reliability": "Recommended for production usage, can be retrained"
    },
    {
      "model_name": "askui-ai-element",
      "infor": "AskUI AI Element allows you to address visual elements like icons or images by demonstrating what you looking for. Therefore, you have to crop out the element and give it a name.",
      "execution_speed": "Very fast, ‘<5ms per step’",
      "security": "Secure hosting by AskUI or on-premise",
      "costs": "Low, ‘<0.05$ per step’",
      "reliability": "Recommended for production usage, cannot be retrained currently"
    }
  ]
}
```

This approach allows you to retrieve the table as a structured JSON object, making it easy to inspect, validate, or process the data programmatically.

> **Tip:**  
> Adjust the schema to match your table’s columns, and use clear instructions to get accurate
